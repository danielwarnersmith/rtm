A tip that makes it easier for you to interact with the Analog Rytm MKII

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>2. THE ANALOG RYTM MKII

Rhythm, a forward motion carried by regular elements and silences, is something that is present in all our lives. You can see it in the motion of the astronomical bodies that creates the shifting of days, months and years. It is also happening inside our human bodies where biological clocks are governing our internal processes. The rhythm of life drives us inexorably forward and carries us along on our journey.

However, rhythm is not only something that controls us, but it is also something we control and create. We harness the rhythm of probability and re-occurrence to guide us to make the right decisions. We create cycles and patterns that help us to make order in a complex world and to establish a sense of stability in life.

Rhythm is also one of the foundational building blocks of music. The steady beat of the drums has been our constant companion throughout all human history. From the primitive beats of the ancient tribal cultures via the classical masters to the dark dance floors of the Berlin clubs - rhythm is there!

The Elektron Analog Rytm MKII truly adds its beat and power to the pulse of life. It is an eight voice analog/ digital hybrid drum machine featuring the twang of the analog domain, the instant control, and effects of the digital domain and the wonderful interplay of both. The analog signal path, digital controls, samples, additive modulation and sampling capability, makes this drum machine a solid instrument with a voice of its own. The innovative combination of modern technology and tried and trusted ways of sound generation lets you create any kind of drum: purely analog, sample-based or a combination of the two. For all its layers of complexity and depth, it remains instantly accessible and - we are sure you agree - fun to play.

Whether the musical world you choose to inhabit is an ordered, harmonious and intelligible one or one of disharmony, chaos and earth-shattering noise, the Analog Rytm MKII will be your guide, companion, and rhythm-maker. It is our firm belief that you will have as much fun using the machine as we have had developing it. Enjoy.

## **DRUM VOICES (x8)**

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **FX TRACK**

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_12_Figure_6.jpeg)

## **4.1 VOICE CIRCUITS**

There are eight analog voice circuits. All voices have an identical sample playback engine, overdrive circuit, and multimode filter. The percussion sound generators are not identical. Each is designed to generate a specific class of analog drum sounds.

#### **4.2 ABOUT MACHINES**

There are several MACHINES available for each voice circuit. A MACHINE is a set of synthesis parameters that control a percussion sound generator to act like a certain drum model. Different MACHINES are software tailored to generate different kinds of bass drums, hi-hats, et cetera - and to provide the parameters most apt for each particular MACHINE. For more information, please see "8.2 MACHINES" on page 22.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>5. OVERVIEW OF THE ANALOG RYTM MKII DATA STRUCTURE

The image below outlines the data structure of the Analog Rytm MKII.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

## 5.1 +DRIVE

The +Drive is a non-volatile storage. It keeps up to 128 projects (thousands of patterns, kits and songs) stored internally. The +Drive also contains the +Drive Sound library, capable of storing 4096 drum Sounds, and the Sample bank. All projects have access to these Sounds and samples.

## 5.2 DATA STRUCTURE

## 5.2.1 PROJECT

A project contains 128 patterns, 128 kits, 16 songs, 4 global slots, 127 sample slots and a project Sound pool consisting of up to 128 Sounds. General settings and states are stored in the project. When a project is loaded it becomes the active working state of the Analog Rytm MKII. From here it is possible to edit the patterns, kits, songs, and globals of the project. Every time the Analog Rytm MKII is switched on, it boots to the active working state, the active project. Projects are saved, loaded and managed in the GLOBAL SETTINGS menu. Read more about projects in the section ["9. PROJECTS" on page 24](#page-23-1).

# 5.2.2 KITS

A kit is a collection of twelve drum track Sounds and the FX track parameter settings. When editing a track, changes made to the parameter settings is stored in the active kit. Each project of the Analog Rytm MKII contains 128 individual kits. A pattern always links to one of the kits. Read more in the section ["10. KITS AND SOUNDS" on page 26.](#page-25-1)

## 5.2.3 SOUNDS

A Sound is a sample plus the parameter settings found in the PARAMETER pages SRC, SMPL, FLTR, AMP, and LFO. Sounds are stored in the Sound pool of the active project or the +Drive Sound library. The Sound pool has 128 Sound slots and the +Drive Sound library holds up to 4096 sounds. Read more in the section ["10. KITS AND SOUNDS" on page 26.](#page-25-1)

## 5.2.4 SAMPLES

You can load up to 64 MB (about 11 minutes) of samples in a project, using a maximum of 127 sample slots. There are many preset samples to choose from in the +Drive Sample bank. Additional samples can be transferred to the Analog Rytm MKII from a computer with the Elektron Transfer software. You can also sample straight into the Analog Rytm MKII. See section ["14. GLOBAL SETTINGS MENU" on page](#page-55-1)  [56](#page-55-1), and ["13. SAMPLING" on page 54.](#page-53-1)

#### 5.2.5 PATTERNS

For each of the 8 banks, 16 patterns are available, which means 128 patterns are always readily available for each project. A pattern contains sequencer data like drum trigs, trig mutes and parameter locks for the drum tracks and the FX track, as well as default settings on the TRIG page and length, swing, and time signature settings. Read more in the section ["11. THE SEQUENCER" on page 37](#page-36-1).

#### <span id="page-14-0"></span>5.2.6 SONGS

16 songs are available for each project. They are used to sequence the playback of patterns. Songs are built of patterns and chains. Read more about songs in the section ["12.2 SONGS" on page 51.](#page-50-1)

#### 5.2.7 GLOBALS

The GLOBAL settings contain overarching settings for the sequencer, MIDI, and global track routing. Four global slots are available for each project, each with its specific settings. Read more about the global settings in the section ["14. GLOBAL SETTINGS MENU" on page 56](#page-55-1).

## 5.3 ABOUT THE TRACKS

The Analog Rytm MKII is played using the [PADS]. The responsive, velocity and pressure sensitive pads can be assigned to perform many possible functions. The \<PADS\> can display a variety of colors. There are a variety of modes: PLAY mode, MUTE mode, CHROMATIC mode, SCENE mode and PERFORMANCE mode.

## 8.1 PADS

The 12 pads dominate the left half of the Analog Rytm MKII front panel. The finger-sized pads are made of sturdy synthetic rubber and respond to pressure. Tapping a pad triggers its track sound. BD triggers the bass drum, SD the snare drum and so on. The illustration outlines and briefly describes the analog percussion sound generators. See the twelve tracks and their default MACHINES below.

| GENERAL MACHINES: NOISE, IMPULSE. |
Play the track Sounds of the active kit using the [PADS]. 8 individual track Sounds can be voiced simultaneously with the eight physical voices of the Analog Rytm MKII. The BD, SD, BT, and LT are independent tracks with their separate voices. Tracks RS-CP, MT-HT, CH-OH and CY-CB, each pair is shown with a coupling on the front panel of the Analog Rytm MKII, share a voice. If you play or trigger both tracks of a coupled pair, the right-hand track has a higher priority. Track CP mutes track RS, HT mutes MT, OH mutes CH and CB mutes CY. With sequencer recording deactivated, drum tracks may also be played using [TRIG] keys 1-12.

The color of the \<PADS\> shows pad activity. A pad flashes white briefly when engaged, whether it is played manually or by the Analog Rytm MKII sequencer. A red color pad shows the active drum track.

# <span id="page-21-1"></span><span id="page-21-0"></span>8.2 MACHINES

Select a drum track MACHINE by quickly pressing the [SRC] key twice or press [FUNC] + [SRC]. A MA-CHINE makes use of the physical percussion sound generator of the voice circuit in a certain way, to make a characteristic drum model.

For example, the BD track uses the sound generator of the first voice circuit. Its default BDHD MACHINE includes one tunable analog oscillator, a choice of three different waveforms and a custom envelope to shape the sound. These MACHINE-specific synthesis parameters are on the SRC parameter page. If you select another MACHINE, it engages the sound generator differently - employing more than one oscillator, for example - enabling the BD track to perform frequency modulation and many other sound generating techniques.

All MACHINES cannot be accessed from all tracks since the tracks control different physical sound generators. The illustration above shows the tracks that can make use of a specific type of percussion sound generator within the boundaries of the same gray-shaded box. For a more comprehensive list of MA-CHINES, the tracks that can use them and the specific SRC page parameters they give access to, please see ["APPENDIX D: MACHINES" on page 92](#page-91-1).

## 8.3 ROTARY ENCODERS

The eight *DATA ENTRY* knobs, the *TRACK LEVEL,* the *QUICK PERF AMOUNT* knob, and the *MAIN VOL-UME* knob are made of sturdy two-component plastic with a shape designed to fit snugly between thumb and forefinger, and a rubbery surface to prevent slipping. The *MAIN VOLUME* and *QUICK PERF AMOUNT*  are absolute encoders, spanning roughly 320 degrees from left extreme to right extreme. A small white dot on its top surface shows the encoders position. The *TRACK LEVEL* and *DATA ENTRY* knobs (with which you set various parameter values for the active kit) are relative encoders that can be rotated any number of turns. Pressing and turning these encoders changes their associated values at a higher speed.

## 8.4 PRAGMATIC OPERATION

The functional layout of the Analog Rytm MKII front panel ensures many complex operations can be done using only one hand, leaving the other hand free to tweak sounds. With all mode and track keys near each other, one-handed track muting, chromatic play, scene change, and performance macro deployment are possible. As is one-handed retrigging, tempo tapping, pattern mode change, and pattern selection.

# 8.5 KEY BEHAVIOR

As a group, the track selection keys ([TRK] + any of the [PADS] and the [FX] key) have radio button functionality, i.e., when a new track is set to be active, the previous one is simultaneously deactivated (one and only one track must always be selected). Likewise, the group that consists of the five [PARAMETER] keys and the [TRIG] key has radio button functionality.

The mode keys [PLAY MODE], [MUTE], [CHRO], [SCNE] and [PERF] keys have both on/off and radio button functionality (which means they can all be switched off, but only one of them can be on at the same time). This behavior goes for the [SONG MODE] and [CHAIN MODE] keys as well.

The [TRK], [FUNC] and [RTRG] keys must be pressed in combination with other keys to exert functionality.

# <span id="page-21-2"></span>8.6 MIDI NOTES

Some functions can be triggered by sending MIDI note values from an external MIDI device (a MIDI keyboard or a computer, for example) connected to the Analog Rytm MKII via standard MIDI cable or a USB 2.0 A to B connector cable.

Of the 128 notes in the standard MIDI range, 0–11 corresponds to notes C0 through to B0, the leftmost octave (which is sometimes called C-2–B-2 in certain applications) will trigger the Sound of track 1 through to track 12, respectively (provided they are set to their default channels 1–12). These note values map to each of the twelve tracks, regardless of which track is active. For more information, please see ["APPENDIX](#page-81-1)  [C: MIDI" on page 82](#page-81-1).

MIDI note values 12–59 (corresponding to notes C1–B4, the second through to the fifth octave in the MIDI range) will trigger the Sound of the active track in any of its 48 chromatic variations (as if played by the pads in CHROMATIC mode, see section below), from lowest to highest pitch. The track Sound must be enabled for chromatic play if any variation is to be heard. Activate via the SOUND SETTINGS. For more information, please see ["10.5.2 SOUND MANAGER" on page 32](#page-31-1).

MIDI program change messages 0–127 selects pattern 1–128 (A01–H16) on the Analog Rytm MKII. Additionally, MIDI CC and NRPN messages can be sent to control various aspects of the Analog Rytm MKII. See ["APPENDIX C: MIDI" on page 82](#page-81-1) for a complete specification.

# <span id="page-22-0"></span>8.7 MODE KEYS

There are five main keys with which you select the mode of operation on the Analog Rytm MKII: [PLAY MODE], [MUTE], [CHRO], [SCNE] and [PERF].

#### 8.7.1 PLAY MODE

To activate the PLAY MODE mode, press the [PLAY MODE] key. In PLAY MODE the pads are used to play the drum Sounds that is loaded to their corresponding track.

#### 8.7.2 MUTE MODE

To activate the MUTE mode, press the [MUTE] key. You can mute the sequencer of any of the twelve drum tracks in this mode. Press any of the [PADS] to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The color of the \<PADS\> indicates the mute status. Muted tracks \<PADS\> are unlit. Audible track pads \<PADS\> are green.

Press and hold [FUNC] and then any of the [PADS] to preselect a mute, or mute/unmute several tracks in one go. Once you release [FUNC], the selected mutes come into effect. Blue color \<PADS\>. show preselected mutes

Press [RTRG] and one of the [PADS] if you wish to activate solo, in other words, mute all tracks except the one selected. Press again to deactivate solo. Keeping [RTRG] pressed, multiple tracks may be solo activated/deactivated. Solo activated \<PADS\> are turquoise.

The tracks you have muted in this mode stay muted even if you change the pattern or load a new kit. After exiting MUTE mode, the [MUTE] key stays lit, half-bright white (red on grey devices) if any of the tracks are muted. The MUTE mode is a part of the active state of the machine. It is not stored to the current kit or pattern. Mutes activated in MUTE mode are the master mutes, and they override any TRIG MUTE patterns on the sequencer or any SONG MUTE program on any pattern of the active song.

#### 8.7.3 CHROMATIC MODE

Pressing the [CHRO] key turns the [PADS] of the Analog Rytm MKII into a chromatic keyboard. When in this mode, you can play the Sound of the active track chromatically.

Any track Sound may be played in this mode using the 12 pads. The chromatic note pitch is linearly increased for each successive pad pressed: left to right, bottom to top. Twelve pads in succession make up one octave. The range spans four octaves, middle, 1 up and 2 down. The middle octave has blue color \<PADS\>, the two below are of violet and dark blue color, in that order, and the one above is yellow. Reach higher or lower octaves, one row at a time, by pressing the [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN], respectively.

The Synth part, the Sample part or both at once of any Sound may be chromatic enabled. This is done in the SOUND SETTINGS. For more information, please see ["10.5.2 SOUND MANAGER" on page 32](#page-31-1).

Notes trigged chromatically can be recorded on the sequencer. Find out how this is done in sections ["11.3.2 GRID RECORDING MODE" on page 39](#page-38-1) and ["11.3.3 LIVE RECORDING MODE" on page 39](#page-38-2).

Like the MUTE mode, the active state of the CHROMATIC mode (the portion of the chromatic keyboard currently visible on the pads) is not stored per kit or pattern but stays in its set state until it is changed.

#### 8.7.4 SCENE MODE

The SCENE mode turns the twelve pads into instant sound shifters. Press a single pad to change several parameters from any track. A scene is a fixed set of parameter values, ready to be activated or deactivated. To activate the SCENE mode, press the [SCNE] key.

By carefully assigning a set of parameter values, you can prepare a scene that makes the same kit sound drastically (or subtly) different whenever activated. After exiting SCENE mode, the [SCNE] key stays lit, half-bright white (red on grey devices) if any of the scenes are active. Unlike the MUTE or CHROMATIC mode, SCENE mode settings are stored in the active kit. See ["10.3 SCENE MODE" on page 28](#page-27-1).

## 8.7.5 PERFORMANCE MODE

Press the [PERF] key to enter PERFORMANCE mode. This mode enables the [PADS] to control several PARAMETER page parameters at once. Change many dimensions of one or more drum track Sounds at the touch of a single pad. A pad in this mode, prepared with one or many additive layers of parameter modulation, is called a performance macro. While setting up a performance macro is done in a similar way as setting up a scene, there is a major difference in the way these two modes operate. A scene is a static, ON/OFF command of an array of parameters set to specific values. A performance macro engages the assigned parameters dynamically. When using a performance macro, the parameters are modulated relative to the pressure applied to the pad. Green color \<PADS\> contains a performance macro.

PERFORMANCE mode settings are stored as part of a kit. For more information, please see ["10.4 PER-](#page-28-1)[FORMANCE MODE" on page 29.](#page-28-1)

# <span id="page-23-1"></span><span id="page-23-0"></span>9. PROJECTS

A project is the top level of the Analog Rytm MKII workflow. A project contains 128 patterns, 128 kits, and 16 songs,

4 global slots, and a project Sound pool consisting of up to 128 Sounds. Projects are handy when, for example, you want to save a specific setup for a live performance or when managing a select number of compositions. The +Drive can store 128 projects.

When a project is loaded it becomes the active working state of Analog Rytm MKII, independent of the +Drive. Analog Rytm MKII keeps track of what project slot the active project was loaded from. It is possible to edit the patterns, kits, songs, and globals of a loaded project.

Within an active project, all changes made are automatically remembered by the Analog Rytm MKII, letting you switch back and forth between patterns and kits and edit the patterns, kits, and parameters in any order you like without the need to save each adjustment manually. Patterns, the active kit Sounds, and settings, songs and globals are remembered even after the power is turned off. However, regarding kits (the main entity for editing and collectively storing a complete set of Sounds and effects), when the Analog Rytm MKII is switched off, only the settings of the active kit are preserved. If for example, the kit linked to pattern 1 is edited (kit A), another pattern is selected and its kit edited (kit B) and then the power is turned off, only the changes to kit B (the most recent active kit) will be remembered. We highly recommend that you specifically save the kits you have been working on manually using the quick command [YES] + [PLAY MODE]. Find out more about kits in the section ["10. KITS AND SOUNDS" on page 26](#page-25-1).

Project changes are not automatically written to the +Drive. To store the active working state of the project to a +Drive slot, the project needs to be saved manually. See below on how to load and save projects.

## 9.1 PROJECT MENU

Projects are managed in the PROJECT menu, located in the GLOBAL SETTINGS menu. Open the GLOBAL SETTINGS menu by pressing [GLOBAL SETTINGS].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_23_Picture_9.jpeg)

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_24_Picture_4.jpeg)

CLEAR resets the project slot to a clean state.

DELETE removes the project from the slot.

RENAME opens a screen where you can rename the project file.

LOAD FROM loads the selected project. This overwrites the active project!

SAVE TO saves the active project to the selected slot.

TOGGLE toggles write protection on and off. Write-protected projects cannot be overwritten, renamed or erased. A write-protected project is shown with a padlock symbol.

INIT NEW initializes an empty file slot with a clean project. This option is only available for empty project slots.

PURGE ALL purges (removes) all Sounds from the Sound pool and all samples that are not used in any pattern in the project from the RAM memory. The Sounds and samples are not removed from the +Drive Sound library. This option is only available when you select the currently loaded project.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_24_Picture_13.jpeg)

- Multiple projects can be selected and deselected by highlighting them and pressing [YES].
- The currently active project is linked to the slot shown with a small arrow in front of the project name.
- A lock symbol indicates the project is write protected.
- Projects can be copied/cleared/pasted.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_24_Picture_18.jpeg)

LOAD FROM in the PROJECT MANAGER overwrites the active project. Be sure to save your project before you load another.

# <span id="page-25-1"></span><span id="page-25-0"></span>10. KITS AND SOUNDS

Every project has the capacity of 128 different kits. A kit is a collection of 12 drum track Sounds and an FX track and their specific parameter settings. A Sound is composed of synth, sample, filter, effect sends, envelope and LFO settings in any combination. Sounds are assigned to the twelve drum tracks.

Each of the drum tracks contains one Sound. The PARAMETER page settings for each track in a kit can be saved as an individual Sound if so desired. A Sound that has been loaded, from the +Drive or the Sound Pool to a track, becomes a part of the active kit. Any changes made to a track Sound do not affect the stored Sound. It affects and become part of the active kit. A pattern, controlling the playback of the kit, always links to a specific kit (non-exclusively). Any changes to the kit affect other patterns using the same kit. When the Analog Rytm MKII is switched off, only the active kit preserves its changes. Other kits must be saved.

#### A Kit contains:

- Sound parameter settings for the 12 drum tracks.
- FX track parameter settings.
- LEVEL settings for the drum and FX tracks.
- RETRIG settings.
- General SOUND SETTINGS.
- PERFORMANCE and SCENE mode macros and parameter settings.

#### A Sound contains:

• Settings for the PARAMETER pages of a drum track.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_25_Picture_13.jpeg)

- The graphics in the top left part of the screen shows the name of the active kit. When you press a [TRK] key and one of the [PADS], this information briefly changes to show the name of the track Sound.
- When you create a brand new pattern, using an existing kit that is already linked to another pattern, we recommend that you save and rename the kit, the first thing you do (see below). Unless, of course, you intend kit changes to affect multiple patterns.

## 10.1 THE +DRIVE SOUND LIBRARY AND THE SOUND POOL

Sounds can be loaded to a kit from either the +Drive Sound library or the Sound pool of the active project. The +Drive Sound library has the capacity of 4096 Sounds, available to all projects. The Sound pool is a part of a project and can contain up to 128 Sounds. The major benefit of Sounds loaded to the Sound pool is the possibility for them to be Sound locked. This feature is not available for the Sounds in the +Drive Sound library. Read more about Sound locking in the section ["11.11.2 SOUND LOCKS" on page 46](#page-45-1).

## <span id="page-25-2"></span>10.2 KIT MENU

In the KIT menu, commands relating to kits are found, including kit save and kit load. Open the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [PLAY MODE]. Use the [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys to move between the commands. Press [YES] to confirm your selection. Exit the menu by pressing [NO].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_25_Picture_20.jpeg)

# 10.2.1 RELOAD KIT

Reloads either the active kit, reverting it to its saved status or all kits. Using the [LEFT] and [RIGHT] keys selects whether only the active kit or all kits will be reloaded. [NO] + [KIT] offers a shortcut to reloading the active kit.

## 10.2.2 LOAD KIT

Opens a menu where one of the up to 128 saved kits can be loaded. The kit list will appear when this menu is accessed. The active kit is shown with inverted graphics. Select the kit you want to load by using the [ARROW] keys or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. [LEFT]/[RIGHT] will quickly scroll between the menu

<span id="page-26-0"></span>pages. Once a kit has been selected, press [YES] to load it. The loaded kit are linked to the active pattern. If the active kit is loaded, it will be reloaded to the state it was saved in. Kits that are not associated with any pattern are distinguished by a star symbol after the kit name.

#### 10.2.3 SAVE KIT

Saves all the current kit related settings as a kit. When a kit is saved, it will be linked to the active pattern. [YES] + [PLAY MODE] offers a shortcut to this command, saving the kit instantly to the same slot and with the name of the kit unchanged. It is good practice to use the shortcut frequently to ensure kit changes are saved.

When this menu is opened, the kit list will appear. The active kit is shown with inverted graphics. Select the slot to which the kit will be saved by using the [ARROW] keys or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. Press [YES] to save to the selected slot. The NAMING screen, covered on page 17, will appear.

## 10.2.4 CLEAR KIT

Clears the content of the currently loaded kit, basically initializing it. When selecting this option a prompt will appear. Press [YES] to clear the kit or [NO] to cancel the operation. Note that no kit information will be permanently lost until the kit is saved to the same kit slot it was loaded from.

#### 10.2.5 TRACK ROUTING KIT

Customizes track routing. The default setting is to use the TRACK ROUTING global settings found in the GLOBAL SETTINGS menu. See section ["14.6 AUDIO ROUTING" on page 63.](#page-62-1)

If you want custom settings for the currently active kit, press [YES] to untick the USE GLOBAL SETTING box and use the [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN] to navigate the menu.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_26_Picture_11.jpeg)

USE GLOBAL SETTING press [YES] if you decide to use GLOBAL settings after all. The \<PADS\> shows what the current GLOBAL settings are for the drum tracks. \<PADS\> of a green color send to main. Unlit \<PADS\> do not.

ROUTE TO MAIN highlight this option to customize which of the 12 tracks will send to the master effects (Distortion and Compressor) and main output. Use the [PADS] to activate/deactivate send from the track of each corresponding pad. \<PADS\> of a green color send to main. Unlit \<PADS\> do not. Note that each track still sends to its individual output.

SEND TO FX highlight this option to customize the send FX routing of the 12 tracks. Use the [PADS] to activate/deactivate each corresponding track for sending to the send FX (Delay and Reverb). \<PADS\> of a yellow color send to FX. Unlit \<PADS\> do not.

# <span id="page-26-1"></span>10.2.6 CONTROL IN 1 MOD

Opens the CONTROL IN 1 MOD setup for Control In 1. Basically this is like a performance macro that you can control with CV or an expression pedal connected to the Control In 1 input (labeled EXP/CV IN 1 on the Analog Rytm MKII back panel). The setup for the Control In 1 input can be found in the GLOBAL SET-TINGS menu. For more information, please see ["14.7 CONTROL" on page 64](#page-63-1). This modulation macro is configured the same way as a performance macro.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_27_Picture_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-27-0"></span>Up to four track parameters can be assigned to a modulation macro. Parameters can be selected from all drum tracks and the FX track. Press *DATA ENTRY* knobs *A–D* to select the track from which parameters you want to assign to the macro. Select the track parameters that will be assigned by turning *DATA EN-TRY* knobs *A-D*. Confirm a selection by clicking the knob or by pressing [YES]. *DATA ENTRY* knobs *E-H* are then used to set the depth of the five track parameters. The depth is an offset of the original track parameter value.

By default, the parameter macro knob spans a parameter value range of -128–127. A parameter macro value of 0 will not introduce any changes to the sound.

The bar on the left in the screen shows a graphical representation of the incoming signal.

## 10.2.7 CONTROL IN 2 MOD

Same functions as CONTROL 1 IN MOD but for CONTROL IN 2.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_27_Picture_7.jpeg)

- Copy, clear and paste operations are available in the LOAD KIT and SAVE KIT menus.
- Use the *TRACK LEVEL* knob to scroll through the LOAD KIT and SAVE KIT menus.
- Once you have assembled a kit you like or changed it to your liking, don't forget to save it using the shortcut [YES] + [PLAY MODE].
- An asterisk symbol following the kit name denotes a kit that is not used by any pattern.

## <span id="page-27-1"></span>10.3 SCENE MODE

Press [SCNE] to enter scene mode. A scene is a collection of fixed parameter locks. It enables an instant makeover of how the tracks of the active kit sound, at the touch of a single pad. 12 scenes may be assigned, one for each of the [PADS].

Press one of the [PADS] when in scene mode to activate a scene. Only one scene may be active at a time. When active, the pad to which the scene is assigned glows blue. The \<PADS\> of non-empty, inactive scenes glow half-bright blue. Empty scenes have unlit pads. If the pad of the active track contains a scene, the pad is violet colored (a mix of the active track color and the scene color, red and blue).

## 10.3.1 SCENE EDIT

There are 12 assignable scenes available, one for each pad. Make sure SCENE mode is active. Select which scene to edit by pressing one of the [PADS]. Then press and hold the [SCNE] key for a short while to edit the scene.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_27_Picture_17.jpeg)

When SCENE mode is active, [FUNC] + one of the [PADS] offers a convenient shortcut to scene edit mode.

When scene edit is active, the bottom of the screen reveals a list showing, from left to right, the scene number, the number of locked parameters, an option to clear the scene and an option to clear all scenes. Use the [ARROW] keys [LEFT] and [RIGHT] to navigate this list.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_27_Picture_20.jpeg)

SCENE shows which scene is being edited. Use [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN] to select another scene.

<span id="page-28-0"></span>LOCKS shows the number of parameter locks assigned to the scene. This changes by adding or removing parameter locks (see below).

\<CLEAR\> clears all parameter locks assigned to the scene being edited. Press [YES] when this option is highlighted to clear the scene.

\<CLEAR ALL\> clears all parameter locks on all the 12 scenes. Press [YES] when this option is highlighted to clear all scenes.

While keeping the scene pad pressed, various parameters can be locked to the scene by turning the *DATA ENTRY* knobs. Any parameter, from any of the 13 tracks, can be modulated and locked to the scene. Choose the drum tracks from which the parameter locks will be assigned by pressing [TRK] + [PADS]. If parameters from the FX track are to be locked to the scene, press the [FX] key. The parameters available for modulation and scene assignation are visible on the screen.

When a scene is edited, the pads of drum tracks containing parameter locks glows half-bright red and flicker. The active track, from which parameter locks are currently set, glows full-bright red. If a scene contains FX track parameter locks, the [FX] key flickers while editing the scene. When the scene pad is pressed during edit, parameter locks are shown with inverted graphics and their fixed values (provided the particular track, and the particular parameter page where the locked parameter is located, is active) are also shown.

A total of 48 different parameters may be locked to any of the 12 scenes, in any combination, for each kit. For example, 48 parameter locks may be used for a single scene, two scenes may use 24 parameter locks each, four scenes may use, say, 2, 4, 10 and 32 parameter locks, and so on.

The scene of each pad can be copied, pasted to another pad or cleared using [FUNC] + [RECORD]/ [STOP]/[PLAY], respectively. SCENE settings are stored to the active kit. Remember to save the kit regularly with [YES] + [PLAY MODE].

Once the editing is done, simply press the [SCNE] key again to exit scene edit mode. The parameter locks you entered will be instantly enabled whenever the scene is activated.

## <span id="page-28-1"></span>10.4 PERFORMANCE MODE

Enter PERFORMANCE mode by pressing the [PERF] key. The PERFORMANCE mode enables you to tweak one or several parameters, chosen from any track, by applying different amounts of pressure to any of the [PADS] containing a performance macro. 12 performances may be assigned, one for each of the [PADS]. Green color \<PADS\> signal that they contain a performance macro.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_28_Picture_11.jpeg)

- By gently increasing the amount of pressure applied to a pad containing a performance macro (or quickly pressing, and then gently releasing the applied pressure), all intermediate values of the parameter lock range can be heard while going from one extreme of the modulation depth to the other.
- Press [FUNC] + [QPER] to mute the PERFORMANCE mode. This temporarily mutes all the changes that have been made to the track parameters by the performance macros. Press [FUNC] + [QPER] again to unmute the PERFORMANCE mode to let the changes affect the parameters again. The [QPER] key is green when PERFORMANCE mode is active and turned off then PERFORMANCE mode is muted.
- As the name implies, the PERFORMANCE mode is a live performance feature. As is the SCENE mode. When recording on the sequencer, PERFORMANCE mode macros and SCENES are not possible to parameter lock.

#### <span id="page-28-2"></span>10.4.1 PERFORMANCE EDIT

Make sure PERFORMANCE mode is active. Press and hold the [PERF] key for a short while to enter edit mode.

There are 12 assignable performance macros available, one for each pad. Select which macro to edit by pressing one of the [PADS]. When performance edit is active, the bottom of the screen reveals a list showing, from left to right, the performance macro number, the number of locked parameters, an option to clear the macro and an option to clear all macros. Use the [ARROW] keys [LEFT] and [RIGHT] to navigate through this list.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-29-0"></span>PERF shows which performance macro is edited. Use [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN] to select another performance macro to edit.

LOCKS shows the number of parameter locks assigned to the performance macro. This figure will only change by adding or removing parameter locks (see below).

\<CLEAR\> clears all parameter locks assigned to the performance macro that you edit. Press [YES] when this option is highlighted to clear the macro.

\<CLEAR ALL\> clears all parameter locks on all the 12 performance macros. Press [YES] when this option is highlighted to clear all macros.

While keeping the pad pressed, various parameters can be locked to the macro by turning the *DATA ENTRY* knobs. Any parameter, from any of the 1 3 tracks, can be locked to the macro. Choose the drum tracks from which the parameter locks will be assigned by pressing [TRK] + [PADS]. If parameters from the FX track are to be locked to the macro, press the [FX] key. The parameters available for modulation and macro assignation will be visible on the screen.

When a macro is edited, the pads of drum tracks containing parameter locks will glow half-bright red and flicker. The active track, from which parameter locks are currently set, will glow full-bright green. If a macro contains FX track parameter locks, the [FX] key will flicker while editing. When a pad containing a performance macro is pressed during edit, parameter locks are shown with inverted graphics and their modulation depth values (provided the particular track, and the particular parameter page where the locked parameter is located, is active) are also shown.

A total of 48 different parameters may be locked to any of the 12 performance macros, in any combination, for each kit. For example, 48 parameter locks may be used for a single macro, two macros may use 24 parameter locks each, four macros may use, say, 2, 4, 10 and 32 parameter locks, and so on.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_29_Picture_9.jpeg)

- While the process of editing a performance macro is similar to editing a scene, the parameter locks have a completely different functionality. Whereas scene mode locks are fixed values, performance mode locks are modulation depth settings.
- If, for example, the TUN parameter on the SRC parameter page of the BD track is locked to a value of +24, the performance macro will, when engaged, perform a relative increase of the TUN setting of the track Sound between 0 and +24, depending on the amount of pressure applied to the pad to which the performance macro is assigned. 0 if no pressure is applied, 12 if medium pressure is applied and 24 if maximum pressure is applied.
- If the TUN parameter is locked to a value of -24 instead, no pressure will produce a relative value decrease of 0, medium pressure -12 and maximum pressure -24.
- Note that the offset is relative to the general TUN (or any other) parameter setting: if the general setting is 30, a parameter lock with a modulation depth of +24 is set, and maximum pressure is applied to the pad which contains the performance macro, the resulting value will be +54.

The macro of each pad can be copied, pasted to another pad or cleared using [FUNC] + [RECORD]/ [STOP]/[PLAY], respectively. PERFORMANCE mode settings are stored to the active kit. Remember to save the kit regularly with [YES] + [PLAY MODE].

Once the editing is done, simply press the [PERF] key again to exit edit mode. The parameter locks you entered will be activated whenever the pad containing the performance macro is pressed, provided PERFORMANCE mode (but not performance edit) is active. The relative modulation depth of all locked parameters will respond to the amount of pressure applied to the pad.

# 10.4.2 QUICK PERFORMANCE

Quick performance gives you the possibility to control one or several of your performance macros with the *QUICK PERF AMOUNT* knob without being in PERFORMANCE mode.

- <span id="page-30-0"></span>1. Press and hold [QPER], and then press one or more [PADS] or [TRIG 1–12] keys to select which performance macros you want to control with the *QUICK PERF AMOUNT* knob. The [PADS] and the [TRIG 1–12] keys correlate to the 12 performance macros you have at your disposal.

# 10.6 PLAYING A SOUND

Press [PLAY MODE] to use the [PADS] to trigger the drum track Sounds, and then tap any of the [PADS] to play the Sounds of the active kit. The \<PADS\> will briefly flash when pressed. Each pad is velocity sensitive, so a gentle tap and a decisive stab on the pad will produce drum sounds of different intensities.

Use [FUNC] + [PADS] to trig the Sound at the velocity set on the trig page for each track (the VEL parameter). You can also set the pads to trigger with a fixed velocity. For more information, please see ["11.8 FIXED](#page-43-1)  [VELOCITY" on page 44.](#page-43-1)

The [TRIG] keys 1-12 can also be used to play the Sounds of the twelve tracks, also at the velocity set on the trig page for each track.

Press and hold [RTRG], then press and hold any of the [PADS] to continuously retrig the track Sound for as long as the pad is held. Play drum rolls in this manner on one or several of the pads, each with its own assignable retrig settings. Pressure controls retrig velocity. Aftertouch is disabled during retrig. See ["11.4](#page-40-1)  [RETRIG MENU" on page 41.](#page-40-1)

Sounds that are designed for aftertouch play may be played by tapping and then pressing a pad without lifting your finger in between. Settings controlling this can be found in the SOUND menu. For more information, please see ["10.5 SOUND MENU" on page 31](#page-30-2).

#### PLAYING A SOUND WITH AN EXTERNAL MIDI UNIT

Besides using the [PADS], the Sounds can also be played using an external MIDI controller or keyboard connected to Analog Rytm MKII. Which MIDI tracks the voices respond to are set up in the MIDI CHAN-NELS menu, covered in the section ["14.4.3 CHANNELS" on page 61](#page-60-1).

# <span id="page-34-0"></span>10.7 EDITING A SOUND

Select one of the drum tracks for editing by pressing [TRK] + one of the [PADS].

Edit a track Sound by adjusting the parameters found on the PARAMETER pages. Access these pages by pressing one of the five [PARAMETER] page keys. Use the *DATA ENTRY* knobs *A-H* to change the parameters. For a complete description of the functions of the parameters, please see ["APPENDIX A: DRUM](#page-73-1)  [TRACK PARAMETERS" on page 74](#page-73-1).

SRC controls the analog drum synthesis parameters of the MACHINE selected.

SMPL controls the sample selection and settings.

FLTR controls the filter mode, cutoff frequency, and envelope.

AMP controls the amplitude parameters, effect sends, and levels.

LFO controls parameters for the LFO of the active track.

When you want to save a particular Sound with all its current parameter settings, use the quick command [YES] + [MUTE]. Toggle destination, Sound Pool or +Drive, by accessing the left-hand menu, [ARROW] key [LEFT], then press [YES]. Select which slot to save to using the [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN], or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob, and press [YES]. If you select a non-empty slot, the current Sound will overwrite the Sound previously saved to the slot. Name the Sound (see "THE NAMING SCREEN" on page 10) and select a suitable tag, or several tags (KICK, SNARE, RIMSHOT et cetera), using the [ARROW] keys + [YES].

The complete Sound, comprised of all its parameter settings, may be copied to another track by first pressing [TRK] + [RECORD], then selecting the track you want to copy the Sound to using [TRK] + one of the [PADS], and finally pasting by pressing [TRK] + [STOP]. Note that the Sound can only be pasted to a track that is compatible with the Sound.

## 10.8 SELECTING A SAMPLE

Any of the 127 samples in the (RAM) memory may be assigned to a Sound on any of the drum tracks. The samples can be replaced, relocated and otherwise managed in the SAMPLES manager found in the GLOB-AL MENU. See section ["14.2 SAMPLES" on page 56.](#page-55-2) Select the active drum track by pressing [TRK] + one of the [PADS]. Open the SAMPLE parameter page by pressing the [SMPL] key.

# 10.9 EDITING THE FX

Select the FX track for editing by pressing the [FX] key. The FX track controls Analog Rytm MKII internal send effects (Delay and Reverb) and master effects (Distortion and Compression). Editing the FX track is similar to editing the Sounds of the drum tracks. The PARAMETER pages contain all FX parameters.

There are five PARAMETER pages for the FX track. Access the PARAMETER pages by pressing one of the [PARAMETER] keys. Use the *DATA ENTRY* knobs *A-H* to change the parameters. The first two, Delay and Reverb, are send effects: their parameters are set on the FX track, but their incoming signals are set on the DEL and REV send parameters on the AMP page of each drum track. The following two, Distortion and Compressor, are master effects: they condition all sounds with distortion or compression. The last page is the dedicated FX track LFO, with which you can temper any of the parameters on the FX track with a custom low-frequency oscillation along one of seven possible waveforms, enabling - to name but one example - tidal modulation of sound distortion. For complete explanations of the parameters on the FX track, please see ["APPENDIX B: FX TRACK PARAMETERS" on page 78.](#page-77-1)

DELAY controls the character, reverb send and volume of the delay send effect.

REVERB controls the character and volume of the reverb send effect.

DIST controls the amount and character of distortion applied.

COMP controls the behavior, volume and dry/wet mix of sound compression.

LFO controls parameters for the FX track LFO.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_35_Picture_16.jpeg)

• FX and track parameter settings are stored as part of a kit. Don't forget to save the kit and give it a unique name once you have achieved the results you want, or simply press [YES] + [PLAY MODE] to quickly save the active kit with its name unchanged.

Set the master return level of the Delay and Reverb outputs on the FX track with the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. These send effects also have individual volume parameters.

# <span id="page-36-1"></span><span id="page-36-0"></span>11. THE SEQUENCER

The sequencer of the Analog Rytm MKII stores beat information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the drum tracks, the FX track and various pattern-specific aspects of these. Each of the 8 banks, ranging from A to H, contains 16 patterns, which means 128 patterns are instantly available for each project. All changes made to the patterns are stored automatically. Changes made to the active pattern can be reverted, as long as it is active. Read more in the "PATTERN MENU" on page 38.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_36_Picture_3.jpeg)

All sequencer tracks on the Analog Rytm MKII can also be set to send sequencer data through the MIDI OUT or USB ports to control external, MIDI equipped, gear. Each track sends note on/off and velocity data over MIDI. For more information, please see ["11.7.1 TRIGS](#page-42-1)  [SETUP MENU" on page 43](#page-42-1).

#### A pattern contains:

- General trig settings on the TRIG page (default note pitch, velocity et cetera).
- Quantization settings.
- Note trigs for all tracks.
- Lock trigs for all tracks.
- Parameter locks.
- Sound locks.
- Trig mutes.
- Accent trigs.
- Slide trigs.
- Swing trigs & swing amount.
- A kit linked to the pattern.
- Length and time signature for the tracks.

# 11.1 BASIC PATTERN OPERATIONS

Analog Rytm MKII can seamlessly switch between patterns. This, along with the ability to chain patterns, is a handy feature when improvising live.

# <span id="page-36-2"></span>11.1.1 SELECTING A PATTERN

Press a [BANK] key. A window will appear on the screen for a short while, displaying "CHOOSE PTN." Press a [TRIG] key to select a pattern within the chosen bank. For example, to select pattern B05, press [BANK B] and then [TRIG 5].

Patterns containing data are shown with half-bright red [TRIG] keys. The current active pattern is shown with a full-bright red [TRIG] keys.

When you select a pattern containing no data, the kit of the previous pattern will be preliminarily selected, and the kit number will start flashing on the screen (to draw attention to the fact that the kit is not yet decisively linked to the new pattern). Load another kit, if you wish, at this point. When you start editing the pattern or save the kit, the kit will be linked to the pattern, and the kit number will stop flashing on the screen.

When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern position will be shown flashing in the lower left corner of the screen (If default, SEQUENTIAL, pattern mode is active). Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will start, and the pattern position will cease to flash.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_36_Picture_25.jpeg)

- Patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running.
- Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages.
- After a pattern is selected, and before releasing any key, [RECORD], [PLAY] and [STOP] can be pressed to copy, clear or paste patterns without leaving the active pattern. It is possible to clear and paste multiple patterns at the same time.

#### 11.1.2 PATTERN CONTROL

Pressing [PLAY] will start the playback of a pattern. Pressing [STOP] will stop the playback of all tracks. The sound will be cut off, but effects like Delay will continue to be audible until the delay repeats have faded out. When the sequencer has stopped, quickly press [STOP] + [STOP] to stop playback of all tracks and fade out the send effects. This also sends out an All Sound Off message over MIDI.

When a pattern is playing and [PLAY] is pressed the playback will be paused. Press [PLAY] again to resume the playback.

<span id="page-37-0"></span>If a pattern contains more than 16 sequencer steps, the \<PATTERN PAGE\> LEDs will indicate this. When a pattern is playing, the currently active pattern page is shown with a flashing, full-bright, \<PATTERN PAGE\> LED.

#### <span id="page-37-1"></span>11.1.3 TEMPO

Press the [TEMPO] to open the TEMPO screen where you can set the overall BPM speed.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_37_Picture_4.jpeg)

Use the *TRACK LEVEL* knob to change the tempo setting. The [UP] and [DOWN] key changes the decimal part of the tempo.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_37_Picture_6.jpeg)

Note that you can choose between a project tempo (same tempo for all the patterns in a project) or use a separate tempo for every pattern. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to switch between PROJECT and PATTERN tempo mode.

To tap a tempo setting, hold the [FUNC] key and tap the [TEMPO] key in a steady rhythm. After four consecutive taps, the average tempo of the taps will be calculated. By continuing tapping, the average tempo will keep on updating.

The tempo can be temporarily nudged up or down by 10% by pressing the [LEFT] or [RIGHT] arrow keys. When the key is released, the BPM will revert to the original setting.

When in the TEMPO menu, holding [FUNC] while turning the *TRACK LEVEL* knob will not change the tempo to the selected value until the [FUNC] key is released. While doing this, "PREP." will flash in the bottom left corner of the screen.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_37_Picture_11.jpeg)

Tempo shift is very handy when manually syncing Analog Rytm MKII to a turntable or an external sound source. Note that you do not need to be in the TEMPO menu to perform tempo shifting

## 11.2 PATTERN MODES

When changing patterns, different modes affecting the way the active pattern will be changed exist. Press [FUNC] + [BANK A–D] to select PATTERN mode. The \<PATTERN MODE\> LEDs indicate which mode is selected. There are four PATTERN modes.

SEQUENTIAL changes patterns after the currently playing pattern reaches its end. This mode is the default mode.

DIRECT START immediately changes patterns. The new pattern will start playing from the beginning.

DIRECT JUMP immediately changes patterns. The new pattern will start playing from the position where the previous pattern left off.

TEMP JUMP works a little bit differently from the other PATTERN modes. It works like this:

1. Press [FUNC] + [BANK D] to arm TEMP JUMP PATTERN mode. The Temp Jump LED starts to flash (if the sequencer is running) to indicate that Temp Jump mode is armed.
2. Select a new pattern. The Temp Jump LED is now firmly lit to indicate that Temp Jump mode is active The pattern changes immediately and the new pattern starts playing from the position where the previous pattern left off. It plays the new pattern once to the end and then return to the pattern that was playing before the change. Once the sequencer has returned to the earlier pattern, then TEMP JUMP mode is no longer active.

You can also use TEMP JUMP mode when you are in CHAIN mode, but then the pattern you change to instead replaces the current pattern in the chain. For example, say that you have a chain set up like this: A01 > A03 > A04 > A02. When the chain is playing, and you are in TEMP JUMP mode, change pattern to A16 while pattern A03 is playing. The pattern will immediately change to A16 and once A16 has ended then the chain will continue to play from pattern A04.

# <span id="page-38-0"></span>11.3 EDITING A PATTERN

Analog Rytm MKII offers three modes of input when editing or creating a pattern, GRID RECORDING mode, LIVE RECORDING mode, and STEP RECORDING mode. In these modes you can add two types of trigs: note trigs and lock trigs.

## 11.3.1 TRIG TYPES

There are two types of trigs, note trigs and lock trigs. Note trigs trig notes while lock trigs are used to apply parameter locks without trigging notes. Note trigs are shown with red [TRIG] keys and lock trigs are shown with yellow [TRIG] keys. Steps not containing any trigs have unlit [TRIG] keys. Read more about parameter locks in section ["11.11.1 PARAMETER LOCKS" on page 46.](#page-45-2) The two types of trigs are entered in different ways on the sequencer depending on whether GRID or LIVE recording mode is active.

#### <span id="page-38-1"></span>11.3.2 GRID RECORDING MODE

GRID RECORDING is a method of composing where you use the [TRIG] keys to add trigs.

Enter GRID RECORDING mode by pressing the [RECORD] key. A lit red [RECORD] key indicates GRID RECORDING mode is active. Select the track to which you want to add trigs, by pressing the [TRK] key + one of the [PADS] (or just by pressing the [PAD] if set up so in the SEQUENCER CONFIG menu). Place note trigs on the sequencer by pressing the [TRIG] keys 1–16 in the sequence desired. When CHRO-MATIC mode is active, the pitch value of the note trig will be recorded according to which [PADS] key is pressed. To add a lock trig, press [FUNC] and [TRIG]. Add micro timing (shifting it forward or backward on the time grid) to a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while pressing [ARROW] keys [LEFT] or [RIGHT]. A micro timing pop-up menu appears, showing the time offset.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_38_Picture_8.jpeg)

Set the retrig speed by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while pressing [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN]. Similarly, a pop-up menu will appear on the screen, where various retrig settings can be made. For more information, please see ["11.4 RETRIG MENU" on page 41](#page-40-1).

If the pattern contains more than 16 steps, select the pattern page you want to edit by pressing the [PAGE] key. The active pattern page is shown with a fully lit \<PATTERN PAGE\> LED.

Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_38_Picture_12.jpeg)

- Press [TRIG] + [YES] to preview a specific trig. The preview includes any parameter locks you have placed on that trig.
- All trigs of a track can be shifted forwards or backward on the sequencer. While in GRID RECORDING mode, hold down [FUNC] while pressing the [LEFT] or [RIGHT] arrow keys to perform the trig shift.

## <span id="page-38-2"></span>11.3.3 LIVE RECORDING MODE

LIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the [PADS] are played in real time to input trigs to the tracks. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real time. Trigs input in LIVE RECORDING mode will be placed on the sequencer in a micro-timed fashion, which means trigs will be placed to more accurately reflect the input timing of the trigs. This makes LIVE RECORDING mode record note inputs in a more real time and non-quantized way. However if you wish, micro timed trigs can be quantized, which is done in the TRIGS SETUP menu accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [TRIG]. For more information, please see ["11.7.1 TRIGS SETUP MENU" on page 43.](#page-42-1)

Hold [RECORD] and press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. The sequencer will start to play, and the [RECORD] key will start to flash. You can now enter trigs to the active track in real time by playing the [PADS]. Key presses on the [PADS] will be recorded as note trigs, and the velocity and duration of the key presses will affect the values of the note trigs. Also, the pitch value of the note trig, if CHRO-MATIC mode is active, will be recorded. Any changes to the PARAMETER page settings, using the *DATA ENTRY* knobs, will be recorded on the sequencer as parameter locks.

<span id="page-39-0"></span>To activate or deactivate quantization of the LIVE RECORDING, press [RECORD], then double-press [PLAY]. Repeat the command to deactivate. Quantization of live recording can also be set in the SE-QUENCER CONFIGURATION menu found in the GLOBAL SETTINGS menu.

Press [NO] + one (or several) of the [PADS] to erase a sequence of recorded trigs on a track (or on several tracks) in time with the sequencer, i.e. all steps reached on the pattern playing will be erased, until the keys are released.

To stop both the recording and the playback of the sequencer, press [STOP]. To exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing, press [PLAY]. If LIVE RECORDING mode is active and [RE-CORD] is pressed, GRID RECORDING mode will be activated.

#### 11.3.4 STEP RECORDING MODE

STEP RECORDING is a quick and straightforward method of placing trigs on the sequencer. In this recording mode, you insert notes by pressing the [PADS] or using an external MIDI controller. The sequencer then captures the note and automatically advances to the next step. There are two different modes available, STANDARD mode and JUMP mode.

#### STANDARD mode

1. Press [RECORD] + [STOP] to enter STEP RECORDING mode. The [RECORD] key starts to double-blink red. (Press [STOP] twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed to toggle between STANDARD and JUMP mode).
2. Press a [TRIG] key to select the active step to where you want to start to add note trigs. The active step is shown with a green [TRIG] key that double-blinks. (If positioned on an earlier placed trig, it inherits the light pattern of that trig). You can also use [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to select the active step or skip steps.
3. Press one or several of the [PADS] simultaneously to add trigs to the corresponding tracks on the active step. The active step then automatically advances to the next step. Press [CHRO] to add trigs to the active track in CHROMATIC mode. Press [TRK] + [PAD] to select active track.
4. To remove a trig on the active track or to add a rest (no trig), position the active step on the trig that you want to remove or add a rest to, and then press [NO]. The active step then automatically advances to the next step.
5. To add a parameter lock to a trig, press and hold a [TRIG] key, and then turn the *DATA ENTRY* knob that controls the parameter you want to lock and set it to the desired value. The graphics become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter value is displayed. The [TRIG] key of the locked trig blinks red (for note trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to indicate that the trig now contains a parameter lock.
6. Press [RECORD] to exit STEP RECORDING mode.

## JUMP mode

In JUMP mode, the LEN parameter setting on the TRIG PARAMETER page controls the note length of the trigs you place, and advances the active step the same length. A LEN value of 1/16 adds a sixteenth note and advances the sequencer one step. 1/8 adds an eighth note and advances the sequencer two steps. 1/4 adds a quarter note and advances the sequencer four steps and so on. The LEN parameter is also parameter locked on every trig you place. If you add trigs from multiple tracks simultaneously the cursor will progress according to the LEN setting of the first track played.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_39_Picture_15.jpeg)

- The [TRIG] keys display the trigs placed on the active track.
- Press [TRIG] + [YES] to preview a specific trig on the active track. The preview includes any parameter locks you have placed on that trig.
- If you press and hold a [PAD], and then press one or several other [PADS] it will add trigs on multiple tracks on the same sequencer step.
- You can press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence while you are programming it. Press [STOP] to stop the sequencer and stay in STEP RECORDING mode.
- If you use an external MIDI controller, you must set it to send MIDI data on the defined AUTO CHANNEL. For more information, please see ["14.4.3 CHANNELS" on page 61](#page-60-1).
- If you use an external MIDI controller, the trig's VEL (velocity) value is determined by the velocity sent from these and is parameter locked (Only on trigs that already contains locked velocity data). But, if you press and hold [FUNC] while inputting notes from an external MIDI controller, the velocity is fixed and determined by the VEL parameter setting.

<span id="page-40-0"></span>![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_40_Picture_1.jpeg)

- If you press and hold [YES] while you place a trig with the [PADS] or an external MIDI controller, the trig length is locked to the time you press the [PADS] or the external MIDI controller.
- If you add a new note trig on a previously placed note trig, any parameter locks previously placed on that trig remain as they were.

## <span id="page-40-1"></span>11.4 RETRIG MENU

When the [RTRG] key is pressed and held, the retrig menu for the active track will appear on the left side of the screen. In this menu, a host of retrig actions can be set. Each of the twelve drum tracks can have its own set of retrig settings. The retrig settings are stored to the active kit.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_40_Picture_6.jpeg)

Use the [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN] to highlight one of the retrig actions (there are more than the four visible on the screen). Change values using the [ARROW] keys [LEFT] and [RIGHT]. The values can also be set using the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. The retrig actions available in this menu are:

RETRIG Sets the retrig rate (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10, 1/12, 1/16, 1/20, 1/24, 1/32, 1/40, 1/48, 1/64 or 1/80). 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 1/32 corresponds to two trigs per step and so on. To trig triplets, for example, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24).

LENGTH Sets the duration of the retrig velocity curve in fractions of, or rational or integer multiples of, a step (0,125 - INF). 1/16 is the nominal length of one step. This setting affects the behavior of the velocity curve (see directly below), by defining the boundaries of its envelope.

VEL. CUR Sets the velocity curve fade out/fade in of the retrig (-128 to 127). -128 corresponds to a complete fade out during the set length, -64 fades out to half the velocity during the set length, 0 equals a flat velocity curve with no fade, 64 fades into half velocity during the set length and 127 fades in completely to full velocity during the set length.

ALWAYS ON Sets retrig lock ON/OFF. When on, the retrig will activate whenever the pad of the active track is pressed without the need to press [RTRG] first.

Retrigs can be recorded on the sequencer in GRID RECORDING mode as well as in LIVE RECORDING mode. Trigless trigs are inserted to record pad pressure changes.

Retrigs can be customized on any of the sequencer steps. Press a [TRIG] key, then press the [RTRG] key or the [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN]. This will bring up a pop-up menu on the screen showing four retrig actions.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_40_Picture_14.jpeg)

As long as the [TRIG] key is pressed, the pop-up menu will remain visible. In order to activate/deactivate the retrig, press the [RTRG] key, or turn *DATA ENTRY* knob *A*. To set the retrig rate, press the [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN] or turn *DATA ENTRY* knob *E*. Change the length of the retrig velocity curve using *DATA ENTRY* knob *D*. The velocity curve of the retrig is set using *DATA ENTRY* knob *H*. The knob works in a bipolar fashion, spanning the range -128 to 127. Negative velocity values fade out the retrig to the set amount, positive values fade it in. The retrig settings in this menu can also be accessed from the RETRIG menu. However, retrig settings placed on a specific trig on the sequencer via the pop-up menu will override the general retrig settings for the active track.

# <span id="page-41-1"></span><span id="page-41-0"></span>11.5 TRACK MENU

Settings and options for the active track are found in this menu. Open the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [CHRO]. Browse the list using the [UP]/[DOWN] arrow keys or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. Select by pressing [YES]. Change the track that will be affected by pressing the [TRK] key + one of the [PADS].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_41_Picture_3.jpeg)

TRIGS SETUP will take you to the TRIGS SETUP menu for the active track. See section ["11.7.1 TRIGS](#page-42-1)  [SETUP MENU" on page 43.](#page-42-1)

RELOAD TRACK will reload the active track. Since tracks are a part of patterns which are automatically saved, it will either be reloaded to its original auto-saved state or to a specifically saved state which can be determined by utilizing the SAVE TRACK command. Press [NO] + [CHRO] for a shortcut to the RELOAD TRACK command.

SAVE TRACK will save changes made to the active track. This is a special feature available in addition to the general, automatic, saving of patterns which occur when patterns are changed. The feature is useful in situations where an individual track is being worked on, the results are desirable, and you want to keep on working with the track while having the ability to revert it to a specifically saved state. The SAVE TRACK command makes this possible. When reloading the track, it will not be reloaded to its original, pattern auto-saved, state, but to the manually saved state. Press [YES] + [CHRO] for a shortcut to the SAVE TRACK command.

## <span id="page-41-2"></span>11.6 PATTERN MENU

In the PATTERN menu patterns can be saved and reloaded. Open the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [SCNE]. Select between the available commands by using the [UP]/[DOWN] arrow keys. Confirm selections with [YES].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_41_Picture_9.jpeg)

RELOAD PATTERN will reload the active pattern. It will either be reloaded to its original auto-saved state or to a specifically saved state which can be determined by utilizing the SAVE PATTERN command. Press [NO] + [SCNE] for a shortcut to the RELOAD PATTERN command.

SAVE PATTERN will save changes made to the active pattern. This is a special feature available in addition to the general, automatic, saving of patterns which occur when patterns are changed. The feature is useful in situations where a pattern is being worked on, the results are desirable, and you want to keep on working with the pattern while having the ability to revert to a specifically saved state. The SAVE PAT-TERN command makes this possible. When reloading the pattern, it will not be reloaded to its original, auto-saved, state, but to the manually saved state. Press [YES] + [SCNE] for a shortcut to the SAVE PATTERN command.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_41_Picture_12.jpeg)

The RELOAD PATTERN command is great when improvising live. Any changes made to the active pattern, like adding bass line notes or similar, can immediately be undone.

# <span id="page-42-2"></span><span id="page-42-0"></span>11.7 TRIG MENU

Set the actions for when a note is trigged in the TRIG menu. Press the [TRIG] key to access the menu. Change settings using the *DATA ENTRY* knobs. These general settings affect note trigs placed on the sequencer. On any step of the pattern, trigs may be locked to other settings by first pressing and holding a [TRIG] key, then changing the settings. Setting SYN and SMP to zero on a note trig turns it into a lock trig. Note that the TRIG settings are stored along with the active pattern, not to the active kit.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_42_Picture_3.jpeg)

NOT sets the pitch of the note when trigged, ranging from -24 to 24. When LIVE RECORDING and playing in CHROMATIC mode, the pitch of the [PADS] played will override this setting.

VEL sets the velocity at which the note trig on the sequencer is trigged, 1 to 127. This velocity is used when trigging with [FUNC] + [PADS] or with the [TRIG] keys or with the pads in FIXED VELOCITY mode and the fixed velocity set to AUTO. In LIVE RECORDING mode, the velocity at which the [PADS] are tapped will override this setting.

LEN sets the length of the note trig. Again, in LIVE RECORDING mode, the duration of pressing the [PADS] overrides this general setting.

PRB Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track plays or not. The probability outcome is re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is 100%, meaning that all the trigs on the track plays every time. (0%–100%)

This parameter changes temporarily to display and control TRC (Trig Condition) when you add a conditional lock. TRC sets the Trig Condition with which a set of conditional rules can be applied to any trig, using a parameter lock. For more information, please see ["11.11.3 CONDITIONAL LOCKS" on page 46](#page-45-3).

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_42_Picture_9.jpeg)

If you have placed a conditional lock on a trig in the sequencer, the trig condition overrides the Trig Probability setting. For example, if you set PRB to 70% and a FILL trig condition on a trig, that trig will only (and always) play when the sequencer is in FILL mode. For more information, please see ["11.11.3 CONDITIONAL LOCKS" on page 46](#page-45-3)

SYN controls if the synth part of the Sound will be trigged.

SMP controls if the sample part of the Sound will be trigged.

ENV controls if the filter envelope will be trigged.

LFO controls if the LFO will be trigged.

## <span id="page-42-1"></span>11.7.1 TRIGS SETUP MENU

Access the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [TRIG]. Navigate the menu using the [UP]/[DOWN] arrow keys or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. Change settings with the [LEFT]/[RIGHT] arrow keys or any of the *DATA ENTRY* knobs.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_42_Figure_17.jpeg)

GLOBAL QUANTIZE will affect all micro-timed trigs of all tracks. The higher the quantize value, the more all micro-timed trigs will be quantized. Range 0-127.

TRK QUANTIZE will affect all micro-timed trigs of the active track. The higher the quantize value, the more all micro-timed trigs will be quantized. Range 0-127.

<span id="page-43-0"></span>TRK SEND MIDI will, when checked, send the tracks note on/off (NOT, LEN) and VEL, sequencer data to the Analog Rytm MKII's MIDI OUT for control of external MIDI devices. The MIDI data is sent on the track's MIDI channel that is set in the CHANNELS menu. For more information, please see ["14.4.3 CHAN-](#page-60-1)[NELS" on page 61](#page-60-1).

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_43_Picture_2.jpeg)

- If TRK SEND MIDI is checked, the track sends the sequencer data both externally over MIDI and internally to the tracks sound.
- Only the sequencer data for note on/off (NOT, LEN) and VEL parameters are sent over MIDI.

## <span id="page-43-1"></span>11.8 FIXED VELOCITY

Press [FIX] to enable the FIXED VELOCITY mode for the pads and set them to trig with a fixed velocity. Press [FUNC] + [FIX] to access the menu where you can adjust the fixed velocity amount.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_43_Picture_7.jpeg)

Set the fixed velocity amount, by turning the *TRACK LEVEL* knob or by pressing [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN]. The default setting is 100. The AUTO setting sets the fixed velocity to the default velocity as specified by the VEL parameter in the TRIG menu. For more information, please see ["11.7 TRIG MENU" on](#page-42-2)  [page 43](#page-42-2).

## 11.9 CLICK TRACK

The CLICK TRACK menu controls the internal metronome of Analog Rytm MKII. Open the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [RTRG]. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] arrow keys or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob to scroll through the list of settings. Press [LEFT]/[RIGHT] or any of the *DATA ENTRY* knobs to change the highlighted setting.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_43_Picture_11.jpeg)

ACTIVE activates/deactivates the metronome. It is also possible, outside of this menu, to keep [FUNC] + [RTRG] pressed for a second to toggle the metronome click on and off.

TIME SIG. NUM controls the note measure of the metronome time signature.

TIME SIG. DEN controls the beat measure of the metronome.

PREROLL controls for how many bars the metronome will sound before the sequencer starts playing. This setting is only relevant when LIVE RECORDING mode is initiated.

VOLUME controls the volume of the click.

## 11.10 SCALE MENU

The length and timing of the pattern can be changed on this screen. Two modes exist in the SCALE menu. In NORMAL mode all tracks share the same length. In ADVANCED mode each track can have different lengths. Access the SCALE SETUP menu by pressing [FUNC] + [PAGE]. Use the [LEFT] and [RIGHT] arrow keys to select between the available settings. Use the [UP] and [DOWN] keys to adjust the different settings and to select between the two modes.

## 11.10.1 NORMAL MODE

This is the default mode. In this mode, all tracks of the pattern share the same length and time signature.

<span id="page-44-0"></span>This screen will appear when the NORMAL setting is active.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_44_Picture_2.jpeg)

The first two settings control the step length of the pattern. The leftmost number selects the number of steps in the pattern. The maximum number of steps available to the pattern is determined by the total length, set by the parameter to the right. This can be either 16, 32, 48 or 64 steps. If 17 steps or more are used in a pattern, the [PAGE] key is, while in GRID RECORDING mode, used to toggle between the different pattern pages.

The rightmost parameter controls the scale (The speed of pattern playback set in multiples of the current tempo). It offers seven possible settings, 1/8X, 1/4X, 1/2X, 3/4X, 1X, 3/2X and 2X. A setting of 1/8X will play back the pattern at one-eighth of the set tempo. 3/4X plays the pattern back at three-quarters of the tempo. 3/2X will play back the pattern twice as fast as the 3/4X setting. 2X will make the pattern play at twice the BPM.

Trigs are automatically copied when extending the length of a pattern. If a pattern consists of for example two pages and the pattern length is increased to four pages; the two added pattern pages will be copies of the first two pattern pages.

Press the [PAGE] key for quickly changing the total length of the pattern. Press the [TRIG] keys to quickly change the number of steps of the pattern.

A 2X time signature setting is useful for increasing the base resolution of the step sequencer to 32nd notes. A 3/4X setting is useful when Analog Rytm MKII is playing alongside other instruments set to the same BPM, and you want Analog Rytm MKII to play triplets.

# 11.10.2 ADVANCED MODE

In this mode, the tracks of the pattern can be assigned individual lengths and scale. Select ADVANCED mode by navigating to the SCALE column using the [LEFT] arrow key. Select ADVANCED by using the [DOWN] arrow key. In ADVANCED mode, two columns exist, TRACK and MASTER.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_44_Picture_10.jpeg)

The TRACK column sets the step length and time signature scale of the track. It works just like setting the pattern length and scale in NORMAL mode. The settings will only affect the active track. Press the [TRK] + [PADS] to select the track whose settings will be edited.

The MASTER column is only available in ADVANCED mode. Here the master length, the master change length and the general time signature of the pattern are set.

LEN controls the amount of steps the pattern will play before all tracks are restarted. An INF setting will make the tracks of the pattern loop infinitely, without ever being restarted. Note that this setting also affects for how long the active pattern will play before a chained pattern starts playing. This can be overridden by the CHNG parameter.

CHNG controls for how long the active pattern will play before a cued or chained pattern will begin to play. This setting is important when for example LEN is set to INF. If no CHNG setting is made, the pattern will play infinitely, and the next pattern will thus not be cued. By default a cued pattern change happens at the end of the pattern (CHNG set to OFF)

MASTER SCALE is the rightmost setting. It sets the general time signature of the pattern.

<span id="page-45-0"></span>![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_45_Picture_1.jpeg)

If INF is selected, the active pattern will play infinitely, making it impossible to change to another pattern (when SEQUENTIAL pattern play mode is used).

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_45_Picture_3.jpeg)

Press [FUNC] + [UP]/[DOWN] to set the lengths in increments of 16.

## 11.11 SEQUENCER FEATURES

#### <span id="page-45-2"></span>11.11.1 PARAMETER LOCKS

Parameter locks enable all trigs to have their unique parameter values. The note trigs of a drum track can have, for example, different pitch, amp or filter settings. All parameters found on the PARAMETER pages are possible to parameter lock, and parameter locks can be applied to all types of tracks. Additionally, all settings on the TRIG page may be locked (see "TRIG MENU" on page 38). For an overview of all parameters on the PARAMETER pages, check out ["APPENDIX A: DRUM TRACK PARAMETERS" on page 74.](#page-73-1)

To apply parameter locks in GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold the [TRIG] key of a trig. Adjust the parameters you want to lock using the *DATA ENTRY* knobs. The graphics in the screen will become inverted for the locked parameter and the locked parameter value will be displayed. The [TRIG] key of the locked trig will begin to flash rapidly, indicating the trig now contains a parameter lock. Remove a single parameter lock by holding [TRIG] + pressing the *DATA ENTRY* knob of the locked parameter. By removing a note trig and entering it again, all parameter locks will be erased from the trig.

In CHROMATIC mode, a note pitch parameter lock will be shown with a red color pad when you press and hold the [TRIG] key containing such a lock.

In LIVE RECORDING mode, turning a *DATA ENTRY* knob, or playing the [PADS] in CHROMATIC mode, will input parameter locks to the active track. Note trigs will be locked accordingly, and lock trigs containing the locks will be placed on the sequencer steps not containing note trigs.

To remove all the parameter locks of the active track while LIVE RECORDING mode is active and the sequencer is running, press and hold [FUNC] + [NO]. All steps reached on the pattern playing will be erased. Sound locks will not be erased.

To remove specific parameter locks in real time, while LIVE RECORDING mode is active and the sequencer is running, press and hold [NO] and then press the *DATA ENTRY* knob corresponding to the parameter that will be removed.

To erase the recorded trigs on a specific track (or on several tracks) while LIVE RECORDING mode is active and the sequencer is running, press and hold [NO] + one (or several) of the [PADS]. All steps reached on the pattern playing will be erased. Sound locks will not be erased.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_45_Picture_14.jpeg)

Up to 72 different parameters can be locked in a pattern. A parameter counts as one (1) locked parameter no matter how many trigs that lock it. If for example the cutoff parameter of the filter is locked on every sequencer step, there are still 71 other parameters that can be locked.

## <span id="page-45-1"></span>11.11.2 SOUND LOCKS

All drum Sounds in the Sound pool of the active project can be changed per sequencer step. Press and hold a note trig and turn the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. The Sound pool list will appear. Scroll the list using the *TRACK LEVEL* knob, select the Sound you want to assign to the note trig and then release the [TRIG] key. The [TRIG] key will start to flash. Press and hold the [TRIG] key of the note trig to show the assigned Sound.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_45_Picture_18.jpeg)

Remember, all Sounds may not be loaded to all tracks. If a Sound in the list is incompatible with the active track, it may not be sound locked. When browsing the Sound pool, Sounds that are incompatible with the active track are shown with a flashing (!) symbol on the screen. As are empty Sound pool slots.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_45_Picture_20.jpeg)

The first position in the Sound pool list, titled TRACK SOUND, is the default selection. It will play the corresponding track Sound of the active kit.

#### <span id="page-45-3"></span>11.11.3 CONDITIONAL LOCKS

On the TRIG PARAMETERS page, there is a parameter called TRC (Trig Condition) with which a set of conditional rules can be applied to any trig, using a parameter lock. You access this parameter by press<span id="page-46-0"></span>ing and holding a trig. The TRC parameter temporarily replaces the PROB parameter while you keep the trig key pressed. Each setting is a logical condition that determines whether a trig set on a track in the sequencer is triggered or not. If the condition is true, then the trig becomes active and affect the track. If the condition is false, the trig is ignored. You must first place a note trig or lock trig on the sequencer step to where you want to apply a conditional lock.

The sequencer needs to be in FILL mode to activate the conditional lock called FILL. For more information, please see ["11.11.4 FILL MODE" on page 47.](#page-46-1)

You can set the following trig conditions:

X% is a probability condition. There is an X% chance that the trig will be active.

FILL is true (activates the trig) when FILL mode is active (see above).

FILL is true when FILL is false. A trig with this trig condition is active when you are not in FILL mode.

PRE is true if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the same track was true. (PRE and PRE conditions are ignored and not evaluated.)

PRE is true when PRE is false. A trig with this trig condition is active if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the same track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions are ignored and not evaluated.)

Example 1: Trig 1, 50% = True > Trig 2, PRE = False > Trig 3, PRE = False > Trig 4, PRE = True

Example 2: Trig 1, 50% = False > Trig 2, PRE = True > Trig 3, PRE = True > Trig 4, PRE = False

NEI is true if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the neighbor track was true. (PRE and PRE conditions on the neighbor track are ignored and not evaluated.) The neighbor track is the track before the active track. For example, track 3 is the neighbor track of track 4. NEI and NEI conditional trigs on track 4 evaluate the conditional trigs placed on track 3. The NEI condition is false if no conditional trigs exist on the neighbor track.

NEI is true when NEI is false. A trig with this trig condition is active if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the neighbor track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions on the neighbor track are ignored and not evaluated.)

1ST is true the first time the pattern plays (when looped).

1ST is true when 1ST is false. A trig with this trig condition is always active apart from the first time the pattern plays (when looped).

A:B A sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length is shorter than the pattern length) plays before the trig condition is true. B sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length is shorter than the pattern length) plays before the count is reset and starts over again. This cycle then repeats until you stop the sequencer.

#### For example:

With the setting 1:2, the trig condition is true the first time the pattern plays and then the third, the fifth, and so on.

With the setting 2:2, the trig condition is true the second time the pattern plays and then the fourth, the sixth, and so on.

With the setting 2:4, the trig condition is true the second time the pattern plays and then the sixth, the tenth, and so on.

With the setting 4:7 the trig condition is true the fourth time the pattern plays and then the eleventh, the eighteenth, and so on.

- Conditional parameter locks are a great way to add variety to a pattern. To set up a grid of mutually exclusive or conclusive note trigs across any of the synth tracks, and throwing some probability locks in there as well is a neat way to make the most minimal of compositions come alive with randomness.
- Note that random or arbitrary variety is not the only way of using conditional trigs. They may also be used, for example, to have two different melodic or percussive sequences on the same track, one of which is activated only when FILL mode is active.

# <span id="page-46-1"></span>11.11.4 FILL MODE

FILL mode can be used to create a temporary variation, such as a drum fill, in your pattern.

Press [FUNC] + [FILL] to cue FILL mode for one pattern cycle. [FILL] starts to flash to indicate that FILL mode is cued. FILL mode will become active ([FILL] shines with a steady light) when the pattern loops, and remain active until the pattern loops again. You can also activate FILL mode at any time, and for any duration, by pressing and holding the [FILL] key when the pattern is playing (GRID RECORDING mode cannot be active). The FILL mode is active for as long as the key is held.

<span id="page-47-0"></span>Press and hold [FUNC] and double-press [FILL] to latch FILL mode. Press [FILL] again to unlatch FILL mode. The [FILL] key lights up blue when FILL mode is latched on.

#### 11.11.5 TRIG MUTE

The TRIG MUTE menu allows you to add mute masks on a sequencer pattern. Each track can have its own trig mute trigs. Open the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [BANK E]. When you open the TRIG MUTE menu, the [TRIG] keys with previously placed note trigs lights up light green and trigs with added trig mute lights up with a darker green.

When this menu is active, place or remove trig mute trigs by pressing the [TRIG] keys. If a trig mute trig is placed on the same sequencer step as a note trig, the note trig will be muted.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_47_Picture_5.jpeg)

If you wish to edit the step property on all tracks simultaneously, not just the active track, press and hold [FUNC] key and then enter the trigs.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_47_Picture_7.jpeg)

- Trig mutes can be quickly added to note trigs or lock trigs. Keep the note trig or lock trig pressed and press [BANK E]. A trig mute trig will automatically be placed on the same sequencer step as the note trig/lock trig.
- Press a note trig/lock trig to quickly see if a trig mute trig is placed on the same sequencer step as the trig. If that is the case, the [BANK E] key will light up.
- Trig mutes are good for experimenting with the feel of tracks when playing live. The last eight steps of a bass line track could, for example, be muted to build suspense.

#### 11.11.6 ACCENT

Adding accent trigs is useful for quickly changing the velocity for chosen steps of a track. Accent level is a destination for modulation, which means it can be affected by, for example, LFOs. Press [FUNC] + [BANK F] to open the ACCENT menu. When you open the ACCENT menu, the [TRIG] keys with previously placed note trigs lights up light magenta and trigs with added accent lights up with a darker magenta.

When this menu is active, place or remove accent trigs by pressing the [TRIG] keys. If an accent trig is placed on the same sequencer step as a note trig, the note trig will be accentuated.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_47_Picture_14.jpeg)

Select the track that will be affected by pressing the corresponding [TRK] key. Select the accent value by turning the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. The higher the value, the more accentuation will be added to accent trigs. If you wish to edit the step property on all tracks simultaneously, not just the active track, press and hold [FUNC] key and then enter the trigs.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_47_Picture_16.jpeg)

- A note trig can be quickly accented. Keep the note trig pressed and press [BANK F]. An accent trig will automatically be placed on the same sequencer step as the note trig.
- Press a note trig/lock trig to quickly see if an accent trig is placed on the same sequencer step as the trig. If that is the case, the [BANK F] key will light up.

#### 11.11.7 SWING

Adjust the swing setting of the pattern, to employ a propulsive, rhythmic groove. Access this menu by

<span id="page-48-0"></span>pressing [FUNC] + [BANK G]. When you open the SWING menu, the [TRIG] keys with previously placed note trigs lights up light yellow and trigs with added swing lights up with a darker yellow.

When this menu is active, place or remove swing trigs by pressing the [TRIG] keys. If a swing trig is placed on the same sequencer step as a note trig, the note trig will be affected by swing.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_48_Picture_3.jpeg)

Set the SWING ratio to 51-80%, by turning the *TRACK LEVEL* knob or by pressing [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN]. The default setting is equal spacing, 50%. Customize the swing pattern, shown by lit [TRIG] keys, using the [TRIG] keys.

#### 11.11.8 PARAMETER SLIDE

The PARAMETER SLIDE menu makes it possible for the parameter values of two separate note trigs or lock trigs of a track to slide between each other. Open the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [BANK H]. When you open the PARAMETER SLIDE menu, the [TRIG] keys with previously placed note trigs lights up light blue and trigs with added parameter slide lights up with a darker blue.

When this menu is active, place or remove parameter slide trigs by pressing the [TRIG] keys. If a parameter slide trig is placed on the same sequencer step as a note trig, the note trig will have a parameter slide. If you wish to edit the step property on all tracks simultaneously, not just the active track, press and hold [FUNC] key and then enter the trigs.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_48_Picture_8.jpeg)

For a parameter value to slide between two trigs, it needs to be locked on one of the trigs. A locked parameter value will slide to the unlocked value and vice versa. To make the parameter value slide, place a slide trig on the same sequencer step as the trig whose parameters you want to slide. The speed of the slide is relative to the current tempo, and the slide is completed when the next trig is reached. Several parameter values can slide at the same time.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_48_Picture_10.jpeg)

- Parameter slides can be quickly added to note trigs or lock trigs. Keep the note trig or lock trig pressed and press [BANK H]. A parameter slide trig will automatically be placed on the same sequencer step as the note trig/lock trig.
- Press a note trig/lock trig to quickly see if a parameter slide trig is placed on the same sequencer step as the trig. If that is the case, the [BANK H] key will light up.

#### 11.11.9 COPY, PASTE, AND CLEAR OPERATIONS

Patterns, track pages, tracks, and trigs can be copied, pasted and cleared.

The active pattern can be copied to either another location in the same bank or to a location in another bank. To perform a pattern copy operation, GRID RECORDING mode must be inactivated. Copy the pattern by pressing [FUNC] + [RECORD]. Select another pattern and paste the copied pattern to this location by pressing [FUNC] + [STOP]. The operation can be undone by pressing [FUNC] + [STOP] again. Clear a pattern by pressing [FUNC] + [PLAY]. Undo the operation by repeating the key presses.

After selecting a pattern, and before releasing any key, [RECORD], [PLAY] and [STOP] can be pressed to copy, clear or paste patterns.

Individual sequencer tracks can be copied, pasted and cleared in the same way as patterns. To do so, GRID RECORDING mode needs to be active.

<span id="page-49-0"></span>A single track page may also be copied, pasted and cleared. It is similar to copying/pasting/clearing a track, but will only affect the active track page. GRID RECORDING mode needs to be active. Select the track page of choice by pressing the [PAGE] key. Copy by pressing [PAGE] + [RECORD]. Select a new track page and press [PAGE] + [STOP] to paste. Undo by pressing [PAGE] + [STOP] again. Press [PAGE] + [PLAY] to clear the active track page. Undo the operation by repeating the key presses.

Trigs, complete with all parameter lock settings, can be copied, pasted and cleared as well. GRID RE-CORDING mode needs to be active to access this functionality.

1. Press and hold one or several trigs and press [RECORD] to perform the copy operation.
2. Press and hold the [TRIG] key to where you want to paste your trig(s), and then press [STOP] to paste the trig(s). When pasting multiple trigs, the copied trigs are placed in the same relation to each other as they had when they were copied. The destination trig acts as the starting point for the sequence of copied trigs.
3. Clear trig locks by holding one or more trigs and press [PLAY].

#### 11.11.10 QUICK SAVE AND RELOAD COMMANDS

Kits, Sounds, tracks, patterns, and songs can instantly be saved and reloaded. When reloading, settings will revert to their saved state.

- To quick save a kit, press [YES] + [PLAY MODE]. This command is the same as the SAVE KIT command found in the KIT menu, see ["10.2 KIT MENU" on page 26](#page-25-2).
- To quick save the track Sound of the active track, press [YES] + [MUTE]. This command is the same as the STORE TRACK SOUND command found in the SOUND MANAGER menu, see ["10.5.2](#page-31-1)  [SOUND MANAGER" on page 32](#page-31-1).
- To quick save a track, press [YES] + [CHRO]. The operation is the same as the SAVE TRACK command, see ["11.5 TRACK MENU" on page 42.](#page-41-1)
- To quick save the active pattern, press [YES] + [SCNE]. The operation is the same as the SAVE PATTERN command, see ["11.6 PATTERN MENU" on page 42](#page-41-2). This is useful to create a restore point before you start a session of live tweaking that might not turn out the way you want.
- To quick save a song, press [YES] + [PERF]. The command is the same as the SAVE command found in the SONG menu, see ["12.2.4 SONG MENU" on page 53.](#page-52-1)
- To quick reload a kit, press [NO] + [PLAY MODE]. This command is the same as the RELOAD KIT command found in the KIT menu, see ["10.2 KIT MENU" on page 26](#page-25-2). This is useful in a live situation after a kit has been subject to improvised changes.
- To quick reload the track Sound of the active track, press [NO] + [MUTE]. This is the same as kit reload, but only on the active track (not all tracks).
- To quick reload a track, press [NO] + [CHRO]. The operation is the same as the RELOAD TRACK command, see ["11.5 TRACK MENU" on page 42.](#page-41-1)
- To quick reload the active pattern, press [NO] + [SCNE]. The operation is the same as the RELOAD PATTERN command, see ["11.6 PATTERN MENU" on page 42](#page-41-2). Only useful until another pattern is selected, as an undo operation after live changes.
- To quick reload a song, press [NO] + [PERF]. The command is the same as the RELOAD command found in the SONG menu, see ["12.2.4 SONG MENU" on page 53.](#page-52-1)

# <span id="page-50-0"></span>12. CHAINS AND SONGS

Chains are sequences that consist of one or more patterns. Chains are used to form songs.

256 pattern entries are available to the 64 chains. For example, one chain can consist of 256 patterns or two chains can consist of 128 patterns each.

One song is always active and worked on. Songs contain two main forms of entries, song rows, and a scratch pad row. The active song row is visible in the bottom left part of the LCD. If a scratch pad row is active, the graphics will show "\_ \_:". The scratch pad row is by default placed after all song rows.

Each song row contains a chain. These entries are saved together with the song. The scratch pad row also contains a chain or a pattern and is also saved as part of the song. The purpose of the scratch pad row is to enable experimentation with chains and patterns without affecting already programmed song rows.

## 12.1 CHAINS

If the active song row or scratch pad row contains a chain, all patterns of the chain will be played when activating the CHAIN mode by pressing [CHAIN MODE] . When deactivating the mode, and SONG mode is not active, the currently active pattern will be played over and over. The active pattern, and any other patterns in the chain are visible at the bottom of the screen. The active pattern is shown with inverted color.

There are two ways to create chains: Detailed chain mode and Quick chain mode.

## 12.1.1 DETAILED MODE

CHAIN mode must be active if you want to create chains in detailed mode. Create chains in detailed mode by pressing [CHAIN MODE] + [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to move the chain cursor. It can either be placed before a pattern, on a pattern or after a pattern. If the cursor is placed before a pattern and a new pattern is selected by pressing [BANK] + [TRIG], the selected pattern will be inserted before the pattern located after the cursor. If the cursor is highlighting a pattern and a new pattern is selected, the highlighted pattern will be replaced. When activating CHAIN mode, the patterns in the chain will be played in sequence. The chain will be looped once the final pattern of the chain has played.

#### 12.1.2 QUICK MODE

To create chains in quick mode, press [BANK] and then press the [TRIG] key for the pattern you want the chain to start with. As long as you keep the first [TRIG] key pressed, subsequent [TRIG] keys pressed will add patterns to the chain. In quick mode, it is only possible to chain patterns from the same bank. Please note that the previous chain will be erased when using quick mode. PATTERN mode must be set to SEQUENTIAL if you wish to create chains in quick mode.

Pressing [CHAIN MODE] + [NO] will, depending on the location of the chain cursor, either erase the pattern located before the cursor or the one highlighted by it.

Pressing [FUNC] + [CHAIN MODE] will create a new, blank, scratch pad row. The scratch pad row will be placed at the very bottom of the song row list (which can be seen when opening the SONG EDIT menu). The content of the previous scratch pad row will be added as a new song row following the last song row. See SONG EDIT MENU on how to relocate song rows (including the scratch pad row) within the song.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_50_Picture_15.jpeg)

CHAIN mode is ideal when improvising live. When CHAIN mode is deactivated and only the currently active pattern is looping, create a chain and then activate CHAIN mode. At any time, exit CHAIN mode to loop one pattern only. Add and remove patterns to create a completely new chain and activate CHAIN mode again. By creating new chains through pressing [FUNC] + [CHAIN MODE], improvised songs can quickly be created.

# <span id="page-50-1"></span>12.2 SONGS

Songs are essentially patterns and chains structured to form a longer sequence. To enter SONG mode, press the [SONG MODE] key. The [SONG MODE] key will light up, indicating SONG mode is active. The active song will start to play, row by row. If the active song row is the scratch pad row (in its bottom-of-thestack default position) it will play through its chain of patterns once, then stop. If the scratch pad row has been moved within the song, it will play the following song row. The song row playing is shown in the lower left corner of the screen.

## 12.2.1 SONG EDIT MENU

Songs are created in the SONG EDIT menu, which is accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [SONG MODE].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_51_Picture_1.jpeg)

<span id="page-51-0"></span>Songs are played row by row, starting from the top and moving towards the bottom. If a song row contains a chain, all patterns in the chain will play before the song play position moves to the next row. The song play position is shown with inverted pattern number graphics. In the top right corner of the screen, the BPM and the amount of played bars and beats is shown.

To navigate between song rows as well as patterns assigned to the song rows, use the [ARROW] keys. When the song cursor highlights a pattern position, the pattern number becomes enclosed by a square. When the song cursor is placed before or after a pattern, it will form a thin line.

To start playing a Song from the beginning, double-press [STOP]. The song play position will automatically be moved to the first pattern of the first song row. Songs can, however, start playing from any pattern position. Highlight a pattern position by moving the song cursor using the [ARROW] keys. Press [YES] to select this position. The graphics will become inverted, indicating this is the song play position. Press [PLAY] to start playing the Song from this position.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_51_Picture_5.jpeg)

Copy, paste, and clear commands can be executed on the song rows.

#### 12.2.2 ADDING SONG ROWS AND ASSIGNING PATTERNS AND CHAINS

Press [FUNC] + [YES] to add a song row. The new song row will be inserted below the row on which the cursor is, and the pattern A01 will automatically be assigned to the new row. To assign another pattern to the song row, use the [ARROW] keys to move the song cursor so the pattern assigned to the row becomes highlighted and then press a [BANK] key + a [TRIG] key. In general, the pattern assigning procedure is the same as when selecting a pattern, covered in the section ["11.1.1 SELECTING A PATTERN"](#page-36-2)  [on page 37](#page-36-2).

To add a chain to a song row, select a song row and press the [RIGHT] arrow key. The song cursor will move from the pattern position and form a thin, standing line. Press a [BANK] key + a [TRIG] key to select the pattern that will be added to the chain.

Remove a pattern in a chain by highlighting it with the song cursor and pressing [FUNC] + [NO].

If a song row contains a chain, individual patterns can be rearranged in the chain. Select the pattern by highlighting it with the song cursor and press [FUNC] + [LEFT]/[RIGHT].

Move a song row up or down in the song by moving the song cursor to the song row and pressing [FUNC] + [UP]/[DOWN].

Erase a song row, one pattern at a time, by pressing [FUNC] + [NO] repeatedly.

## 12.2.3 ADDING REPEATS AND MUTES

Various extra information can be entered for song rows and the pattern or patterns assigned to the song rows.

Repeat a song row a chosen number of times by moving to the leftmost position of the song row with the cursor. Turn *DATA ENTRY* knob *A* to select how many times the song row will be repeated.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_51_Picture_17.jpeg)

<span id="page-52-0"></span>You can selectively mute the sequencers tracks of any pattern while in song edit mode. First, make sure MUTE mode is on. If not, press [MUTE] and make sure the [MUTE] key is fully lit. Then, in the song editor, place the cursor on the pattern you wish to mute tracks on using the [ARROW] keys and press [YES]. Press and hold the [SONG MODE] key + press the [PADS] of the drum tracks you wish to mute.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_52_Picture_2.jpeg)

The mute graphics on the bottom right of the screen will show the muted tracks with a (-) symbol. Unmuted tracks are shown as squares. To mute tracks of another pattern in the song, simply move the cursor to that pattern using the [ARROW] keys and press [YES]. Song mutes are pattern specific. Different patterns can have different song muted tracks. Note that it is the pattern at a specific position in the song which will be affected: if for example, pattern A01 is used in multiple places in the song and the top left instance of it is track muted, all other instances of pattern A01 will remain unchanged. To mute the tracks of another pattern position, simply place the cursor on top of it, press [YES] and add mutes as instructed above. In addition to being shown on the screen, muted tracks in a song are also shown with unlit \<PADS\> when a pattern is highlighted. Unmuted tracks is shown with green-yellow color \<PADS\>.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_52_Picture_4.jpeg)

When a song contains programmed mutes, the [MUTE] key and the [SONG MODE] and [CHAIN MODE] keys will be dimly lit, whether any of these modes are active or not. This feature is intended to help show that there are active song mutes in one of the patterns. Additionally, whenever a pattern containing song mutes is selected, and MUTE mode is active, the \<PADS\> sporting programmed mutes will exhibit a dim green color (unless the song muted tracks are already muted in regular MUTE mode, in which case the \<PADS\> will simply be unlit).

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_52_Picture_6.jpeg)

Even outside of SONG EDIT, song mutes may be instantly added to any track of the active pattern in a chain or song. Just activate MUTE mode by pressing the [MUTE] key. Then, as in SONG EDIT, press and hold [SONG MODE] and tap the [PADS] of the tracks you wish to mute.

## <span id="page-52-1"></span>12.2.4 SONG MENU

In the SONG menu, songs can be saved, loaded renamed et cetera. Access the menu by pressing [FUNC] + [PERF].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_52_Picture_10.jpeg)

RELOAD will reload the active song. It will be restored to its saved version. Press [NO] + [SONG] for a shortcut to this command.

LOAD will open a menu where saved songs can be loaded. The active song is shown with inverted graphics.

SAVE will save the active song to one of the 16 song slots. The active song is shown with inverted graphics. Press [YES] + [SONG] for a shortcut to this command.

CLEAR will clear the active song from all content.

EDIT will open the EDIT menu. It is the same menu as accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [SONG MODE]. See page 47 for more info about this menu.

RENAME will open a menu where the active song can be renamed.

# <span id="page-53-1"></span><span id="page-53-0"></span>13. SAMPLING

Analog Rytm MKII is also a competent and accessible sampler. It can sample audio from external sources via the AUDIO IN inputs, and it can also sample audio internally from the Analog Rytm MKII itself. The maximum sampling time is 33 seconds.

## 13.1 SAMPLING MENU

The SAMPLING menu offers settings that control the different aspects of sampling.

Press [SAMPLING] to access this menu. Use the *DATA ENTRY* knobs to change the parameters.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_53_Picture_6.jpeg)

## 13.1.1 REC

Press [FUNC] + [YES] to start sampling. Press [YES] to stop sampling.

## 13.1.2 ARM

Press [YES] to arm the sampler. The sampler is now in arm mode and it will start sampling when the incoming audio exceeds the threshold level. See below. (Press [SAMPLING] + [NO] to cancel.)

#### 13.1.3 THR

If you have selected to arm the sampler, the sampling begins when the incoming audio signal exceeds the threshold setting. Set the threshold high enough so that it is not triggered by background noise, but low enough that you capture all of the signal.

#### 13.1.4 SRC

Source selects between different audio sources to sample from.

- AUD L+R sets the input source to sample external audio through the AUDIO IN L+R inputs. The audio is summed together to mono.
- AUD L sets the input source to AUDIO IN L.
- AUD R sets the input source to AUDIO IN R.
- BD, SD, RS/CP, BT, LT, MT/HT, CH/OH, CY/CB sets the input source to the internal audio from the separate drum tracks.
- MAIN sets the input source to the internal MAIN L+R channels. The audio is summed together to mono.
- USB L+R sets the input source to sample external audio (from both left and right channel) through the USB input. The audio is summed together to mono.
- USB L sets the input source to sample external audio from only the left channel of the incoming audio from the USB input.
- USB R sets the input source to sample external audio from only the right channel of the incoming audio from the USB input.

#### 13.1.5 MON

Selects the option to monitor the incoming audio through the Analog Rytm MKII or not.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_53_Picture_25.jpeg)

Please note that in most cases you always monitor the internal audio and this parameter is then not available when you chose the separate drum tracks or MAIN as input sources. However, if your sample source is an individual track that you have routed not to send audio to the MAIN OUT, then the MON parameter is available. For more information, please see ["14.6](#page-62-1)  [AUDIO ROUTING" on page 63.](#page-62-1)

## <span id="page-54-0"></span>13.2 SAMPLING WITH THE ANALOG RYTM MKII

1. If you use an external audio source, connect it to the Analog Rytm MKII.
2. Press [SAMPLING] to access the SAMPLING menu and then use *DATA ENTRY* knob *G* to set SOURCE to your preferred audio input source.
3. Keep an eye on the audio input meter and play the audio source and make sure that the volume of the audio source is as strong as possible, but without clipping or distorting. If needed, set MON to YES to monitor the incoming audio through the Analog Rytm MKII.
4. Again, with an eye on the audio input meter, use *DATA ENTRY* knob *F* to set THR just above the indicated background noise of the audio source (when it is not playing).
5. Press [YES] to arm the sampler and then play the sound source. When the incoming audio signal exceeds the set threshold level, sampling will start.
6. Press [YES] when you want to stop sampling. The Analog Rytm MKII then automatically normalizes the sample.
7. Use the *DATA ENTRY* knobs *A* and *C* to set the parameters TRIM START and TRIM END to trim the sample to the desired length. You can use the *DATA ENTRY* knobs *B* and *D* to zoom in and out to make it easier to see where to trim the sample. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to preview the sample. Press [YES] to trim the sample. After you have trimmed the sample, you can press [NO] to untrim the sample if you are not happy with the result.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_54_Picture_9.jpeg)

8. Press [YES] to save the sample.
9. Name the sample and press [YES] again to confirm the save.
10.Press one of the [PADS] to select the track to where you want to assign the sample. Press [NO] if you don't want to assign the sample to a track.

Press [FUNC] + [NO] if you wish to discard the sample.

Press [NO] to close the SAMPLING menu.

# 13.3 DIRECT SAMPLING

You can also perform sampling without using the SAMPLING menu. This is achieved by a set of key press combinations. The sampler will use the SRC and THR settings that were last used.

1. Press [SAMPLING] + [YES] to arm the sampler. The [SAMPLING] key turns yellow. You can also start direct sampling without arming the sampler first. Press [FUNC] + [SAMPLING] to manually start sampling.
2. When the incoming audio signal exceeds the set threshold level (or you manually start direct sampling), the sampling starts, and the [SAMPLING] key turns red.
3. Press [FUNC] + [SAMPLING] to stop sampling. The [SAMPLING] key first turns dim red while normalizing the sample, then green when it is done.

Press [SAMPLING] + [NO] to cancel at any stage of the Direct Sampling process.

# <span id="page-55-1"></span><span id="page-55-0"></span>14. GLOBAL SETTINGS MENU

The GLOBAL SETTINGS menu offers settings that affect Analog Rytm MKII on a global level. Global sequencer, MIDI, and track routing settings are made here. Up to four Global slots are available, each with its individual settings.

Access the menu by pressing [GLOBAL SETTINGS]. Scroll the list by using [UP]/[DOWN] or the *TRACK LEVEL* knob. Open a highlighted menu by pressing [YES].

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_55_Picture_4.jpeg)

## 14.1 PROJECT

This is where you manage the projects. This menu is described in the section ["9. PROJECTS" on page 24.](#page-23-1)

## <span id="page-55-2"></span>14.2 SAMPLES

Manage your samples here. On the main screen, seen below, you can access one of three main directories, FACTORY, INCOMING, or recorded. In the FACTORY directory, several preset samples can be found in one of the ten subdirectories. The INCOMING directory, is the default destination for samples sent to the Analog Rytm MKII +Drive storage via the C6 utility software. The RECORDED directory is the default destination for samples that is sampled with the Analog Rytm MKII. Press [YES] to open a directory.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_55_Picture_9.jpeg)

To open a subdirectory, simply highlight it using the [ARROW] keys and press [YES]. To exit a directory and back one step up in the directory hierarchy, select the item labeled ".." at the very top of the screen and press [YES]. Do this repeatedly to return to the top of the directory hierarchy. You can also press [FUNC] + [RIGHT] to open a directory and [FUNC] + [LEFT] to exit a directory and back one step up in the hierarchy. To discern directories from sample files, all directories, including the directory exit row, "..", are labeled with a (D) at the end of the row.

## <span id="page-62-1"></span>14.6 AUDIO ROUTING

In this menu, you can customize track routing and the routing of audio to and from a class compliant audio device. Use [ARROW] keys [UP] and [DOWN] to navigate the menu.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_62_Picture_15.jpeg)

ROUTE TO MAIN highlight this option to customize which of the 12 tracks will send to the main output. Use the [PADS] to activate/deactivate send from the track of each corresponding pad. \<PADS\> of a green color send to main. Unlit \<PADS\> do not. Note that each track will still send to its individual output.

SEND TO FX highlight this option to customize the FX routing of the 12 tracks. Use the [PADS] to activate/deactivate each corresponding track for routing through the FX. \<PADS\> of a yellow color route to FX. Unlit \<PADS\> do not.

USB IN sets where the incoming audio from the class compliant device is routed to in the Analog Rytm MKII's signal path. This parameter is only available when USB CONFIG is set to USB AUDIO/MIDI. For more information, please see ["14.8.1 USB CONFIG" on page 65.](#page-64-1)

PRE-FX the incoming audio is routed in before the Analog Rytm MKII's effects and will be affected by those and then be sent at the main outputs. The audio is also routed to the sampler.

POST-FX the incoming audio is routed in after the Analog Rytm MKII's effects and will not be affected by those. The audio is then sent at the main outputs. The audio is also routed to the sampler.

TRACK 1–12, L:1–12/R:1–12 Press a [PAD] twice to select a single track as a destination. The selected track's [PAD] (or [PADS] if you selected a track that shares its voice with another track) lights up white. The incoming audio is summed to mono and routed to the selected track and is affected by the tracks parameters (such as filter, envelope).

Press first one [PAD] and then another to select two separate tracks as destinations. The selected tracks' [PADS] lights up blue for left channel and red for right channel. The incoming audio's left and right signal is then sent to separate tracks and is affected by the tracks' parameters.

The audio is also routed to the sampler.

SAMPLER ONLY the incoming audio is only routed to the Analog Rytm MKII's sampler and not to any track or to the main out.

<span id="page-63-0"></span>![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_63_Picture_1.jpeg)

To be able to hear and process the incoming audio sent to one (or two) of the Analog Rytm MKII's tracks, you must place a note trig on the selected track(s) and start the sequencer. This is needed to trigger and open the track's envelope and let the audio through. For continuous processing, set the trig's LEN parameter to INF.

USB OUT sets from where in the Analog Rytm MKII's signal path, the outgoing audio is routed to the class compliant device. This parameter is only available when USB CONFIG is set to USB AUDIO/MIDI. For more information, please see ["14.8.1 USB CONFIG" on page 65](#page-64-1).

MAIN OUT the outgoing audio is routed from the Analog Rytm MKII's main out at the end of the signal path.

TRACK 1–12, L:1–12/R:1–12 Press a [PAD] twice to select a single track as a source The selected track's [PAD] (or [PADS] if you selected a track that shares its voice with another track) lights up white.

Press first one [PAD] and then another to select two separate tracks as sources. The selected tracks' [PADS] lights up blue for left channel and red for right channel. The audio from the tracks is routed out and sent separately on left and right channel.

AUDIO IN the outgoing audio is routed straight from the Analog Rytm MKII's audio inputs to the class compliant device.

OFF no audio is sent to the class compliant device.

USB TO MAIN [dB] sets the amount of amplification of the sound that is streamed over USB to the Analog Rytm MKII's main out when used with a class compliant audio device. (0 dB–+18 dB) This parameter is only available when USB CONFIG is set to USB AUDIO/MIDI. For more information, please see ["14.8.1](#page-64-1)  [USB CONFIG" on page 65](#page-64-1).

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_63_Picture_10.jpeg)

The possibility of routing audio routing to and from a class compliant device opens up several exciting possibilities. For example you can send the audio from TRACK 1 to a class compliant device, let it process the audio and then send the processed audio back to the Analog RYTM MKII's main outs. To achieve this, use these settings:

- TO MAIN = disable TRACK 1
- TO FX = disable TRACK 1
- USB IN = POST-FX
- USB OUT = TRACK 1
- In the class compliant device, route the incoming audio to a FX plugin and then route the processed audio to its output.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_63_Picture_17.jpeg)

- Some of the ANALOG RYTMS MKII's tracks (3/4, 7/8, 9/10, 11/12) share the same voice and can not be chosen as separate inputs/outputs for L/R audio configurations simultaneously. I.e. you can not choose track 3 for left channel and track 4 for right channel.
- Please note that the chosen settings for USB IN and USB OUT and settings made in the class compliant device's applications can cause an audio feedback loop resulting in extreme audio levels.

## <span id="page-63-1"></span>14.7 CONTROL

# <span id="page-73-1"></span><span id="page-73-0"></span>APPENDIX A: DRUM TRACK PARAMETERS

This appendix lists the parameters on the PARAMETER pages for the drum tracks and explains them. With one exception, each page contains the same parameters on all drum tracks. The exception is the SRC page, where parameters will vary depending on the active MACHINE.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_73_Picture_3.jpeg)

- You can randomize the parameter settings on a specific PARAMETER page of a track. Press [PARAMETER] key + [YES] to randomize all parameters on that page. Every time you press this key combination, the parameters randomize in a new way.
- Press [PARAMETER] key + [NO] to reset the PARAMETER page to its last saved state.
- The parameters on the TRIG page can not be randomized.

## A.1 SRC

Controls the (analog and digital) sound synthesis. The default parameters for the BD track with the BDHD machine are shown here. For the SRC pages of other machines, see ["APPENDIX D: MACHINES" on page](#page-91-1)  [92.](#page-91-1)

## SYNTH (BDHD)

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_73_Picture_10.jpeg)

TUN (Tune) sets the pitch of the voltage controlled oscillator in chromatic semitones. (-64–+63)

SWT (Sweep Time) sets the pitch sweep time. Low values result in a short sweep, while high values result in a long sweep. (0–127)

SNP (Snap Amount) sets the amount of snap, an immediate pitch sweep at the start of the sound attack phase. Use together with TIC to shape the transient sound components. (0–127)

DEC (Decay) sets the length of the decay phase. Low values mean a steep, quick decay while high values produce a more gentle slope and a sound of longer duration. (0–127)

WAV (Waveform) sets the voltage controlled oscillator waveform to sine, asymmetric sine or triangle. The three waveforms, in that order, produce sounds with increasing amounts of overtone content. (0, 1 or 2).

HLD (Hold) sets the length of the hold phase before the decay phase kicks in. Low values correspond to short hold time, high values correspond to longer hold time. Use to shape the body of the drum sound. (0–127)

TIC (Tick Level) sets the level of the transient tick sound. Use together with SNP to shape the composite transient sound. (0–127)

LEV (Level) sets the volume of the SYNTH sound. (0–127)

## A.2 SMPL PAGE 1

The parameters on this page control the playback of the samples. A project has 127 sample slots. Within each kit, these samples may be dynamically allocated, modulated and customized.

Press [SMPL] to access this parameter page and to toggle between SMPLE PAGE 1 and SMPL PAGE 2.

# SAMPLE PAGE 1

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_73_Picture_23.jpeg)

<span id="page-74-0"></span>TUN (Tune) sets the pitch of the sample in equivalents of chromatic semitones. To move faster, press the knob while turning it. The knob works in a bipolar fashion, with 0, north, leaving the pitch unchanged. Range (-24–+24), equivalent to four octaves.

FIN (Fine Tune) fine tunes the pitch of the sample. This parameter is an offset from the TUN parameter. The knob works in a bipolar fashion. The whole range (-64–+63) spans one semitone down and one semitone up.

BR (Bit Reduction) increasing the value of this parameter decreases the resolution of the sample, making it more grainy. Use when you want the sound of your drum sample to punch dirty like the sound effects of classic coin-op fighting games. (0–127)

SMP (Sample Slot) turn this knob to browse the list of up to 127 samples loaded into the project. Turn the knob clockwise to scroll down the list, counter-clockwise to scroll up. The first position, OFF, plays no sample at all (OFF, 1–127).

STA (Start) sets the starting point for the playback of the sample. The extreme values of the range (0- 120) are the very beginning and the very end of the sample, respectively. This is a codependent parameter and must be set together with END.

END (End) sets the end point for the playback of the sample. The extreme values of the range (0-120) are the very beginning and the very end of the sample, respectively. If the value of END is lower than the value of STA, the sample will be played back backward.

LOP (Loop) when OFF, the sample will be played back once every time it is trigged. When ON, the sample will loop continuously for the length of the trig (set with LEN on the TRIG page), confined by the AMP page envelope parameter settings HLD and DEC. (1/0 - ON/OFF).

LEV (Level) sets the volume of the sample. (0–127)

# A.3 SMPL PAGE 2

Same parameters as on SMPL page 1 but with a graphical representation of the parameters and a view of the sample waveform.

Press [SMPL] to access this parameter page and to toggle between SMPLE PAGE 1 and SMPL PAGE 2.

## SAMPLE PAGE 2

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_74_Figure_13.jpeg)

# A.4 FLTR

On the FILTER page you will find all parameters that control the analog multimode filter and its associated envelope.

## FILTER

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_74_Figure_17.jpeg)

ATK (Attack) sets the length of the attack phase of the filter envelope. (0–127)

DEC (Decay) sets the length of the decay of the filter envelope. (0–127)

SUS (Sustain Level) sets the sustain level of the filter envelope. (0–127)

REL (Release) sets the length of the release phase of the filter envelope. (0–127)

<span id="page-75-0"></span>FRQ (Frequency) sets the cutoff frequency of the multimode filter. (0–127)

RES (Resonance) sets the resonance behavior of the filter. Resonance introduces a peak in the spectrum at the cutoff frequency. With the Bandstop filter type, there is a notch instead of a peak. The notch will be at its widest at the lowest Resonance setting. (0–127)

TYP (Filter Type) selects the filter type. Seven types are available: 2-pole Lowpass, 1-pole Lowpass, Bandpass, 1-pole Highpass, 2-pole Highpass, Bandstop, and Peak. Technically all of them are resonant 2-pole filters, but the 1-pole types have a flatter spectrum like simple 1-pole filters and are convenient for equalizer duties.

ENV (Envelope Depth) sets the depth of modulation within the filter envelope. The knob is bipolar, meaning that both negative and positive modulation depth is available. Range (-64–+63)

## A.5 AMP

The AMP page controls parameters for the amplitude envelope, overdrive, effects sends, panning and volume.

#### AMP

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_75_Picture_8.jpeg)

ATK (Attack) sets the length of the attack phase of the amp envelope. (0–127)

HLD (Hold) sets the length of the hold phase of the amp envelope before the decay phase kicks in. Range (AUTO, 1–127). The AUTO setting means the hold phase is determined by the time the pad of the drum track is physically pressed. Values in the range (1–127) fix the hold phase, from very short times at the left extreme to increasingly long times to the right, regardless of how long the pad is pressed.

DEC (Decay) sets the length of the decay phase of the amp envelope. (0–INF)

OVR (Overdrive) sets the overdrive (gain increase boost of the amp), located before the multimode filter in the signal path. (0–127)

DEL (Delay Send) sets the amount of the Sound that will be sent through to the Delay effect (see ["AP-](#page-77-1)[PENDIX B: FX TRACK PARAMETERS" on page 78](#page-77-1)). (0–127)

REV (Reverb Send) sets the amount of the Sound that will be sent through to the Reverb effect (see Appendix B). (0–127)

PAN (Pan) positions the Sound in the stereo field. The knob function is bipolar with 0 being the perfectly balanced midpoint, -64 sending all sound to the left channel and +63 sending all sound to the right.

VOL (Volume) sets the volume of amplification of the Sound. This parameter is independent of the overall track level. (0–127)

## A.6 LFO

The LFO can be used to interfere creatively with any parameter found on the SRC, SMPL, FLTR and AMP pages. Customize the low-frequency oscillator behavior, orientation, and depth on this page.

## LFO

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_75_Picture_20.jpeg)

SPD (Speed) sets the speed of the LFO. For the LFO to be synced to straight beats, try settings of 8, 16 or 32. The knob is bi-polar. The LFO cycle can be played backward by using negative values. (-64–+63)

MUL (Multiplier) multiplies the SPD parameter by the set factor. (x) multiplies the current tempo, (dot) syncs the LFO to 120 BPM regardless of the tempo. 24 settings: (12 tempo synced, 12 free).

FAD (Fade In/Out) makes it possible to fade in/fade out the LFO modulation. The knob is bipolar. Positive values give a fade-out, negative values give a fade-in. A mid position (0) will result in no fade in/fade out. (-64–+63)

DST (Destination) selects the destination for the LFO. A list will appear when you turn the knob. Choose a parameter from any of the parameter pages. Turn the knob clockwise to go down the list, counterclockwise to go up. Preview how the LFO modulation will affect the sound by highlighting a destination. Confirm a selection by pressing [YES].

WAV (Waveform) sets the LFO waveform. There are seven waveforms: Triangle, Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Exponential, Ramp and Random.

SPH (Start Phase) sets the LFO cycle start position when it is trigged. Range (0-127). 0 is the start of a complete wave cycle and 127 is the end point. 64 is the dead center.

MOD (Trig Mode) sets how the LFO will act when a note is trigged. Five settings exist.

- FREE is the default free-running mode. It makes the LFO run continuously, never restarting or stopping.
- TRIG makes the LFO restart when a note is trigged.
- HOLD makes the LFO run free in the background, but when a note is trigged the LFO output level is latched and held still until the next note is trigged.
- ONE The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the end of the waveform and then stops. This makes the LFO function similar to an envelope.
- HALF The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the middle of the waveform and then stops.

DEP (Depth) sets the depth and polar orientation of the LFO modulation. Both negative (inverted) and positive modulation depth is possible. Positive values start the oscillation toward the crest phase of the wave, negative values start toward the trough phase of the wave. A dead center setting, 0, equals no modulation depth at all. (-128–+127)

# <span id="page-77-1"></span><span id="page-77-0"></span>APPENDIX B: FX TRACK PARAMETERS

In this appendix, the parameters of the FX track are shown and explained, one page at a time.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_77_Picture_3.jpeg)

Press [FX] + [NO] to reset the parameters on all parameters pages for the FX track to their last saved state.

## B.1 DELAY

The Delay send effect takes a duplicate of the input signal, delays it in time and then rejoins it with the original signal. Customize the delay parameters on this page.

## DELAY

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_77_Picture_8.jpeg)

TIM (Delay Time) sets the delay time. It is relative to the current BPM and is measured in 128th notes. For instance, a setting of 32 equals a one beat delay (four sixteenth notes). (1–128)

X (Pingpong) sets the delay signal to alternate across the stereo field. There are two settings:

- 0 (off) if you wish to manually set the position of the delay signal in the stereo field instead. Do so using the WID parameter.
- 1 (on) makes the delay signal alternate between left and right pan positions. The WID parameter controls the amount of panning.

WID (Stereo Width) sets the delay signal pan width across the stereo field. The knob is bipolar. (-64–+63)

FDB (Feedback) sets the amount of delay output signal to feed back into the input of the delay. With higher parameter settings, infinite and/or swelling delays are possible to achieve. Please be aware that high feedback can lead to a very loud signal, and that the DOV parameter on the DISTORTION page can further increase the harshness of the feedback. (1–198)

HPF (HP Filter) sets the cutoff frequency of the delay highpass filter. (0–127)

LPF (LP Filter) sets the cutoff frequency of the delay lowpass filter. (0–127)

REV (Reverb Send) sets the amount of Delay output signal to be sent to the Reverb. (0–127)

VOL (Mix Volume) adjusts the volume of the Delay output signal. The output is routed either before or after the Distortion and Compressor effects, depending on the setting of the DEL parameter on the DIS-TORTION page. (0–127)

## B.2 REVERB

The Reverb send effect controls the persistence, and ambient characteristics, of the sound reverberations. It can simulate many different sonic locations, from great spaces to small confinements.

## REVERB

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_77_Picture_22.jpeg)

PRE (Pre-delay) sets the pre-delay time of the Reverb. (0–127)

<span id="page-78-0"></span>DEC (Decay) sets the length of the decay phase of the reverberated signal, essentially setting the size of the acoustic space. (1–INF)

FRQ (Shelving Frequency) sets the shelving filter frequency. Together with the GAI parameter, it can be used to dampen the reverberated signal above a chosen frequency, making the reverberation sound more clear or more muffled. (0–127)

GAI (Shelving Gain) affects the damping of the reverberated signal above the shelving frequency set by the FRQ parameter. At max value, the treble is included in the reverberations; lowering the value and gradually dampens it. (0–127)

HPF (HP Filter) sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb high-pass filter. (0–127)

LPF (LP Filter) sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb low-pass filter. (0–127)

VOL (Mix Volume) sets the volume of the Reverb output signal. The output is routed either before or after the Distortion and Compressor effects, depending on the setting of the REV parameter on the DISTOR-TION page. (0–127)

## B.3 DISTORTION

The distortion master effect pronounces the peaks of the signal and distorts them. Additionally, the sound may be offset in its entirety on this page and subjected to non-symmetrical distortion. This page also controls the overdrive of the Delay effect, as well as the routing of the Delay and Reverb effect returns.

#### DIST

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_78_Picture_10.jpeg)

AMT (Distortion Amount) sets the amount of distortion applied to the signal. (0–127)

SYM (Distortion Symmetry) offsets the whole signal (in the y-direction, if visualized as a wave cycle on a 2D graph) either up (positive values) or down (negative values) before applying distortion. This makes asymmetric distortion of the signal possible, fringing only the crests or the troughs of the wave. (-64– +63)

DOV (Delay Overdrive) sets the overdrive of the Delay effect, for a warm, dynamic distortion of the signal. Set this in conjunction with the FDB parameter on the DELAY page to produce anything from a tinge of shear to a very aggressive four-pound barrage of overtones. (0–127)

DEL (Delay Dist/Comp) sets the Delay effect to return before (PRE), or after (POST) the signal is subject to distortion and compression. The default setting is before. (PRE, POST)

REV (Reverb Dist/Comp) sets the Reverb effect to return before (PRE), or after (POST) the signal is subject to distortion and compression. The default setting is after. (PRE, POST)

## B.4 COMPRESSOR

The Compressor master effect compresses the dynamic range of the signal by reducing the volume of loud sounds relative to the quiet sounds. There are eight parameters with which the compressor is customized on this page.

## COMP

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_78_Figure_19.jpeg)

<span id="page-79-0"></span>THR (Threshold) sets the threshold of the compressor. A lower threshold means a larger portion of the signal will be subject to compression. (0–127)

ATK (Attack) sets the time of the compressor attack phase, i.e., how quickly the compressor responds to loud peaks. The time of the attack phase is set in milliseconds. (0.03–30)

REL (Release) sets the time of the compressor release phase, i.e., how long it takes for the compression to recover in quieter moments. The time is set in seconds. Range (0.1–2, A1 or A2). A1 and A2 are two types of auto release phases, (A2) being slightly longer than (A1).

MUP (Makeup Gain) sets the makeup gain of the compressor output, to compensate for the reduced signal levels caused by compression. (0–127)

RAT (Compression Ratio) There are four different compression ratios, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and MAX. Higher ratios result in greater compression of the signal.

SEQ (Sidechain EQ) filters the signal before it is analyzed by the compressor in one of the following ways:

- OFF lets the sidechain signal remain unchanged.
- LPF lowpass filters the signal before analysis, making the compressor react mostly to the bass. Use this setting for a characteristic pumping compressor sound.
- HPF passes the signal through a highpass filter before it is analyzed, making the compressor react less to the bass. Use this setting to avoid pumping.
- HIT results in a balanced equalization of the sidechain signal, making the compressor react similarly to all frequencies of the signal.

MIX (Dry/Wet Mix) sets the mix of the uncompressed signal and the compressor output signal. The left extreme setting results in a completely uncompressed signal. The extreme right setting lets only the compressed signal pass through. All values in between mix the uncompressed signal with the compressed signal, also known as parallel compression. A definitive Motown compression effect may be achieved at moderate MIX settings combined with high RAT and low MUP settings. (0–127)

VOL (Volume) sets the volume of the output signal. (0–127)

# B.5 FX LFO

The FX track LFO page parameters are shown and explained below.

LFO

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_79_Picture_16.jpeg)

SPD (Speed) sets the speed of the LFO. For the LFO to be synced to straight beats, try settings of 8, 16 or 32. The knob is bi-polar. The LFO cycle can be played backward by using negative values. (-64–+63)

MUL (Multiplier) multiplies the SPD parameter by the set factor. (x) multiplies the current tempo, (dot) syncs the LFO to 120 BPM regardless of the tempo. 24 settings: (12 tempo synced, 12 free).

FAD (Fade In/Out) makes it possible to fade in/fade out the LFO modulation. The knob is bipolar. Positive values give a fade-out, negative values give a fade-in. A mid position (0) will result in no fade in/fade out. (-64–+63)

DST (Destination) selects the destination for the LFO. A list will appear when you turn the knob. Choose a parameter from any of the parameter pages. Turn the knob clockwise to go down the list, counterclockwise to go up. Preview how the LFO modulation will affect the sound by highlighting a destination. Confirm a selection by pressing [YES].

WAV (Waveform) sets the LFO waveform. There are seven waveforms: Triangle, Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Exponential, Ramp, and Random.

SPH (Start Phase) sets the wave phase where the LFO will start when it is trigged. (0–127) 0 is the start of a complete wave cycle, and 127 is the end point. 64 is the dead center.

MOD (Trig Mode) sets how the LFO will act when a note is trigged. Five settings exist.

- FREE is the default free-running mode. It makes the LFO run continuously, never restarting or stopping.
- TRIG makes the LFO restart when a note is trigged.
- HOLD makes the LFO run free in the background, but when a note is trigged the LFO output level is latched and held still until the next note is trigged.
- ONE The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the end of the waveform and then stops. This makes the LFO function similar to an envelope.
- HALF The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the middle of the waveform and then stops.

DEP (Depth) sets the depth and polar orientation of the LFO modulation. Both negative (inverted) and positive modulation depth is possible. Positive values start the oscillation toward the crest phase of the wave. Negative values start toward the trough phase of the wave. A dead center setting, 0, equals no modulation depth at all. (-128–+127)

## C.8 MIDI NOTE TRIGGERS

Some functions of the Analog Rytm MKII can be triggered by sending MIDI note values from an external MIDI device.

Note that the tracks needs to be set to their default channels 1–12 to be triggered by C0–B0. For more information, please see ["8.6 MIDI NOTES" on page 22](#page-21-2).
