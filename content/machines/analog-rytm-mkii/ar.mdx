# 4. ANALOG RYTM MKII SOUND ARCHITECTURE

The Analog Rytm MKII sound architecture, with its eight drum voices, two send effects (delay and reverb), and two master effects (distortion and compressor), is shown below. Analog elements are gray; digital elements are white.

#### **DRUM VOICES (x8)**

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **FX TRACK**

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_12_Figure_6.jpeg)

## **4.1 VOICE CIRCUITS**

There are eight analog voice circuits. All voices have an identical sample playback engine, overdrive circuit, and multimode filter. The percussion sound generators are not identical. Each is designed to generate a specific class of analog drum sounds.

#### **4.2 ABOUT MACHINES**

There are several MACHINES available for each voice circuit. A MACHINE is a set of synthesis parameters that control a percussion sound generator to act like a certain drum model. Different MACHINES are software tailored to generate different kinds of bass drums, hi-hats, et cetera - and to provide the parameters most apt for each particular MACHINE. For more information, please see "8.2 MACHINES" on page 22.

# 5. OVERVIEW OF THE ANALOG RYTM MKII DATA STRUCTURE

The image below outlines the data structure of the Analog Rytm MKII.

![](/machines/analog-rytm-mkii/images/_page_13_Figure_3.jpeg)

# 5.1 +DRIVE

The +Drive is a non-volatile storage. It keeps up to 128 projects (thousands of patterns, kits and songs) stored internally. The +Drive also contains the +Drive Sound library, capable of storing 4096 drum Sounds, and the Sample bank. All projects have access to these Sounds and samples.

# 5.2 DATA STRUCTURE

### 5.2.1 PROJECT

A project contains 128 patterns, 128 kits, 16 songs, 4 global slots, 127 sample slots and a project Sound pool consisting of up to 128 Sounds. General settings and states are stored in the project. When a project is loaded it becomes the active working state of the Analog Rytm MKII. From here it is possible to edit the patterns, kits, songs, and globals of the project. Every time the Analog Rytm MKII is switched on, it boots to the active working state, the active project. Projects are saved, loaded and managed in the GLOBAL SETTINGS menu. Read more about projects in the section ["9. PROJECTS" on page 24](#page-23-0).

# 5.2.2 KITS

A kit is a collection of twelve drum track Sounds and the FX track parameter settings. When editing a track, changes made to the parameter settings is stored in the active kit. Each project of the Analog Rytm MKII contains 128 individual kits. A pattern always links to one of the kits. Read more in the section ["10. KITS AND SOUNDS" on page 26.](#page-25-0)

### 5.2.3 SOUNDS

A Sound is a sample plus the parameter settings found in the PARAMETER pages SRC, SMPL, FLTR, AMP, and LFO. Sounds are stored in the Sound pool of the active project or the +Drive Sound library. The Sound pool has 128 Sound slots and the +Drive Sound library holds up to 4096 sounds. Read more in the section ["10. KITS AND SOUNDS" on page 26.](#page-25-0)

## 5.2.4 SAMPLES

You can load up to 64 MB (about 11 minutes) of samples in a project, using a maximum of 127 sample slots. There are many preset samples to choose from in the +Drive Sample bank. Additional samples can be transferred to the Analog Rytm MKII from a computer with the Elektron Transfer software. You can also sample straight into the Analog Rytm MKII. See section ["14. GLOBAL SETTINGS MENU" on page](#page-55-0)  [56](#page-55-0), and ["13. SAMPLING" on page 54.](#page-53-0)

#### 5.2.5 PATTERNS

For each of the 8 banks, 16 patterns are available, which means 128 patterns are always readily available for each project. A pattern contains sequencer data like drum trigs, trig mutes and parameter locks for the drum tracks and the FX track, as well as default settings on the TRIG page and length, swing, and time signature settings. Read more in the section ["11. THE SEQUENCER" on page 37](#page-36-0).

#### 5.2.6 SONGS

16 songs are available for each project. They are used to sequence the playback of patterns. Songs are built of patterns and chains. Read more about songs in the section ["12.2 SONGS" on page 51.](#page-50-0)

#### 5.2.7 GLOBALS

The GLOBAL settings contain overarching settings for the sequencer, MIDI, and global track routing. Four global slots are available for each project, each with its specific settings. Read more about the global settings in the section ["14. GLOBAL SETTINGS MENU" on page 56](#page-55-0).

The Analog Rytm MKII is played using the [PADS]. The responsive, velocity and pressure sensitive pads can be assigned to perform many possible functions. The \<PADS\> can display a variety of colors. There are a variety of modes: PLAY mode, MUTE mode, CHROMATIC mode, SCENE mode and PERFORMANCE mode.

### 8.1 PADS

The 12 pads dominate the left half of the Analog Rytm MKII front panel. The finger-sized pads are made of sturdy synthetic rubber and respond to pressure. Tapping a pad triggers its track sound. BD triggers the bass drum, SD the snare drum and so on. The illustration outlines and briefly describes the analog percussion sound generators. See the twelve tracks and their default MACHINES below.

Play the track Sounds of the active kit using the [PADS]. 8 individual track Sounds can be voiced simultaneously with the eight physical voices of the Analog Rytm MKII. The BD, SD, BT, and LT are independent tracks with their separate voices. Tracks RS-CP, MT-HT, CH-OH and CY-CB, each pair is shown with a coupling on the front panel of the Analog Rytm MKII, share a voice. If you play or trigger both tracks of a coupled pair, the right-hand track has a higher priority. Track CP mutes track RS, HT mutes MT, OH mutes CH and CB mutes CY. With sequencer recording deactivated, drum tracks may also be played using [TRIG] keys 1-12.

The color of the \<PADS\> shows pad activity. A pad flashes white briefly when engaged, whether it is played manually or by the Analog Rytm MKII sequencer. A red color pad shows the active drum track.

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>8.2 MACHINES

Select a drum track MACHINE by quickly pressing the [SRC] key twice or press [FUNC] + [SRC]. A MA-CHINE makes use of the physical percussion sound generator of the voice circuit in a certain way, to make a characteristic drum model.

For example, the BD track uses the sound generator of the first voice circuit. Its default BDHD MACHINE includes one tunable analog oscillator, a choice of three different waveforms and a custom envelope to shape the sound. These MACHINE-specific synthesis parameters are on the SRC parameter page. If you select another MACHINE, it engages the sound generator differently - employing more than one oscillator, for example - enabling the BD track to perform frequency modulation and many other sound generating techniques.

All MACHINES cannot be accessed from all tracks since the tracks control different physical sound generators. The illustration above shows the tracks that can make use of a specific type of percussion sound generator within the boundaries of the same gray-shaded box. For a more comprehensive list of MA-CHINES, the tracks that can use them and the specific SRC page parameters they give access to, please see ["APPENDIX D: MACHINES" on page 92](#page-91-0).

## 8.3 ROTARY ENCODERS

The eight *DATA ENTRY* knobs, the *TRACK LEVEL,* the *QUICK PERF AMOUNT* knob, and the *MAIN VOL-UME* knob are made of sturdy two-component plastic with a shape designed to fit snugly between thumb and forefinger, and a rubbery surface to prevent slipping. The *MAIN VOLUME* and *QUICK PERF AMOUNT*  are absolute encoders, spanning roughly 320 degrees from left extreme to right extreme. A small white dot on its top surface shows the encoders position. The *TRACK LEVEL* and *DATA ENTRY* knobs (with which you set various parameter values for the active kit) are relative encoders that can be rotated any number of turns. Pressing and turning these encoders changes their associated values at a higher speed.

## 8.4 PRAGMATIC OPERATION

The functional layout of the Analog Rytm MKII front panel ensures many complex operations can be done using only one hand, leaving the other hand free to tweak sounds. With all mode and track keys near each other, one-handed track muting, chromatic play, scene change, and performance macro deployment are possible. As is one-handed retrigging, tempo tapping, pattern mode change, and pattern selection.

# 8.5 KEY BEHAVIOR

As a group, the track selection keys ([TRK] + any of the [PADS] and the [FX] key) have radio button functionality, i.e., when a new track is set to be active, the previous one is simultaneously deactivated (one and only one track must always be selected). Likewise, the group that consists of the five [PARAMETER] keys and the [TRIG] key has radio button functionality.

The mode keys [PLAY MODE], [MUTE], [CHRO], [SCNE] and [PERF] keys have both on/off and radio button functionality (which means they can all be switched off, but only one of them can be on at the same time). This behavior goes for the [SONG MODE] and [CHAIN MODE] keys as well.

The [TRK], [FUNC] and [RTRG] keys must be pressed in combination with other keys to exert functionality.

# 8.6 MIDI NOTES

Some functions can be triggered by sending MIDI note values from an external MIDI device (a MIDI keyboard or a computer, for example) connected to the Analog Rytm MKII via standard MIDI cable or a USB 2.0 A to B connector cable.

Of the 128 notes in the standard MIDI range, 0–11 corresponds to notes C0 through to B0, the leftmost octave (which is sometimes called C-2–B-2 in certain applications) will trigger the Sound of track 1 through to track 12, respectively (provided they are set to their default channels 1–12). These note values map to each of the twelve tracks, regardless of which track is active. For more information, please see ["APPENDIX](#page-81-0)  [C: MIDI" on page 82](#page-81-0).

MIDI note values 12–59 (corresponding to notes C1–B4, the second through to the fifth octave in the MIDI range) will trigger the Sound of the active track in any of its 48 chromatic variations (as if played by the pads in CHROMATIC mode, see section below), from lowest to highest pitch. The track Sound must be enabled for chromatic play if any variation is to be heard. Activate via the SOUND SETTINGS. For more information, please see ["10.5.2 SOUND MANAGER" on page 32](#page-31-0).

MIDI program change messages 0–127 selects pattern 1–128 (A01–H16) on the Analog Rytm MKII. Additionally, MIDI CC and NRPN messages can be sent to control various aspects of the Analog Rytm MKII. See ["APPENDIX C: MIDI" on page 82](#page-81-0) for a complete specification.

# 8.7 MODE KEYS

There are five main keys with which you select the mode of operation on the Analog Rytm MKII: [PLAY MODE], [MUTE], [CHRO], [SCNE] and [PERF].

#### 8.7.1 PLAY MODE

To activate the PLAY MODE mode, press the [PLAY MODE] key. In PLAY MODE the pads are used to play the drum Sounds that is loaded to their corresponding track.

#### 8.7.2 MUTE MODE

To activate the MUTE mode, press the [MUTE] key. You can mute the sequencer of any of the twelve drum tracks in this mode. Press any of the [PADS] to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The color of the \<PADS\> indicates the mute status. Muted tracks \<PADS\> are unlit. Audible track pads \<PADS\> are green.

Press and hold [FUNC] and then any of the [PADS] to preselect a mute, or mute/unmute several tracks in one go. Once you release [FUNC], the selected mutes come into effect. Blue color \<PADS\>. show preselected mutes

Press [RTRG] and one of the [PADS] if you wish to activate solo, in other words, mute all tracks except the one selected. Press again to deactivate solo. Keeping [RTRG] pressed, multiple tracks may be solo activated/deactivated. Solo activated \<PADS\> are turquoise.

The tracks you have muted in this mode stay muted even if you change the pattern or load a new kit. After exiting MUTE mode, the [MUTE] key stays lit, half-bright white (red on grey devices) if any of the tracks are muted. The MUTE mode is a part of the active state of the machine. It is not stored to the current kit or pattern. Mutes activated in MUTE mode are the master mutes, and they override any TRIG MUTE patterns on the sequencer or any SONG MUTE program on any pattern of the active song.

#### 8.7.3 CHROMATIC MODE

Pressing the [CHRO] key turns the [PADS] of the Analog Rytm MKII into a chromatic keyboard. When in this mode, you can play the Sound of the active track chromatically.

Any track Sound may be played in this mode using the 12 pads. The chromatic note pitch is linearly increased for each successive pad pressed: left to right, bottom to top. Twelve pads in succession make up one octave. The range spans four octaves, middle, 1 up and 2 down. The middle octave has blue color \<PADS\>, the two below are of violet and dark blue color, in that order, and the one above is yellow. Reach higher or lower octaves, one row at a time, by pressing the [ARROW] keys [UP] or [DOWN], respectively.

The Synth part, the Sample part or both at once of any Sound may be chromatic enabled. This is done in the SOUND SETTINGS. For more information, please see ["10.5.2 SOUND MANAGER" on page 32](#page-31-0).

Notes trigged chromatically can be recorded on the sequencer. Find out how this is done in sections ["11.3.2 GRID RECORDING MODE" on page 39](#page-38-0) and ["11.3.3 LIVE RECORDING MODE" on page 39](#page-38-1).

Like the MUTE mode, the active state of the CHROMATIC mode (the portion of the chromatic keyboard currently visible on the pads) is not stored per kit or pattern but stays in its set state until it is changed.

#### 8.7.4 SCENE MODE

The SCENE mode turns the twelve pads into instant sound shifters. Press a single pad to change several parameters from any track. A scene is a fixed set of parameter values, ready to be activated or deactivated. To activate the SCENE mode, press the [SCNE] key.

By carefully assigning a set of parameter values, you can prepare a scene that makes the same kit sound drastically (or subtly) different whenever activated. After exiting SCENE mode, the [SCNE] key stays lit, half-bright white (red on grey devices) if any of the scenes are active. Unlike the MUTE or CHROMATIC mode, SCENE mode settings are stored in the active kit. See ["10.3 SCENE MODE" on page 28](#page-27-0).

### 8.7.5 PERFORMANCE MODE

Press the [PERF] key to enter PERFORMANCE mode. This mode enables the [PADS] to control several PARAMETER page parameters at once. Change many dimensions of one or more drum track Sounds at the touch of a single pad. A pad in this mode, prepared with one or many additive layers of parameter modulation, is called a performance macro. While setting up a performance macro is done in a similar way as setting up a scene, there is a major difference in the way these two modes operate. A scene is a static, ON/OFF command of an array of parameters set to specific values. A performance macro engages the assigned parameters dynamically. When using a performance macro, the parameters are modulated relative to the pressure applied to the pad. Green color \<PADS\> contains a performance macro.

PERFORMANCE mode settings are stored as part of a kit. For more information, please see ["10.4 PER-](#page-28-0)[FORMANCE MODE" on page 29.](#page-28-0)
