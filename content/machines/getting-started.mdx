# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation! This guide will help you understand the project structure and get up and running quickly.

## Overview

This documentation site is built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js** - React framework with App Router
- **Contentlayer** - Type-safe content layer for MDX
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Pagefind** - Static full-text search

## Quick Start

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Install Dependencies
npm install

# Start the Development Server
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** The search functionality requires a production build. Run `npm run build` to generate the search index.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key directories:

```
app/                  # Next.js App Router pages
  docs/[slug]/        # Dynamic documentation routes
  search/             # Search page
components/           # React components
  mdx/                # MDX component overrides
content/              # MDX content files
  docs/               # Documentation pages
```

## Adding Content

To add new documentation pages:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `content/docs/`
2. Add frontmatter with required fields:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "A brief description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
date: "2024-01-15"
---

# Your Content Here
```

3. The page will automatically be available at `/docs/your-file-name`

## Code Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically highlighted using Shiki:

```typescript
// TypeScript example with syntax highlighting
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}
```

```python
# Python Example
def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n numbers."""
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence[:n]
```

## Callouts

Use blockquotes for important notes and callouts:

> **Important:** This is a callout block. Use it to highlight important information that readers should pay attention to.

## Links

Internal links work with Next.js routing:

- [Back to Home](/)
- [Search Documentation](/search)

External links open in a new tab:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with the basics:

1. Explore the existing documentation
2. Try adding your own content
3. Customize the styling in `tailwind.config.ts`
4. Build and test the search functionality

Happy documenting!
